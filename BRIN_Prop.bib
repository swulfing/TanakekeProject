	abstract = {Mangrove forests are remarkably diverse and productive ecosystems, with distinctive biophysical environments in intertidal coastal regions of the tropics and subtropics. In these regions, shrimp cultivation is identified as a profitable business and one of the main reasons for clearing of mangroves to construct shrimp farms. Against this backdrop and based on the first author's previous PhD research and other relevant scholarly works, in this commentary we discuss the aspects and contexts of the mangrove-based integrated shrimp farming system. Then, we recommend a model of co-management and a set of policy option towards sustainable silvo-aquaculture to protect/restore the mangrove forests and sustain shrimp production in coastal areas of Bangladesh. Mangroves and shrimp culture are not necessarily incompatible. Many mangrove species have been identified as beneficial for shrimp culture for a number of possible reasons. Most importantly, the nutrients in the leaf litter of several mangrove species have been found to enhance natural food production for shrimp. Besides the nutrient input, the leaf litter also provides surface area for biofilm development, on which different life stages of shrimp can graze. In addition, the combination of mangrove leaf litter and feed has been shown to enhance shrimp production synergistically. Additional economic benefits from mangrove-shrimp co-management include the production of timber (e.g. buildings, boats and fuel woods) and non-timber products (e.g. fruits, honey, fibers, firewood, resins and bark). Thus, mangrove-based aquaculture or silvo-aquaculture system can be considered as a nature-based solution to sustainably revitalize the economy in coastal areas where shrimp has been the economic mainstay. Though there are positive effects, we point out some potential negative impacts of mangrove-based shrimp culture, like the anti-nutrients content in the leaf litter, which might impact shrimp production. In addition, the long term use of mangrove leaf litter might degrade the water quality. Therefore, the co-management policy recommends a controlled practice of mangroves in shrimp culture to balance conservation of mangrove-based ecology and profitable shrimp production. The approach promotes nature-based solutions and fosters sustain­ able pathways for food production, considering socio-economic and environmental dynamics.},

While assessments of flood risk mitigation by coastal ecosystems are mainly restricted to local scales, our study assesses the contribution of salt marshes and mangroves to nature-based storm surge mitigation in 11 large deltas around the world. We present a relatively simple GIS model that, based on globally available input data, provides an estimation of the tidal wetland’s capacity of risk mitigation at a regional scale. It shows the high potential of nature-based solutions, as tidal wetlands, to provide storm surge mitigation to more than 80\% of the flood-exposed land area for 4 of the 11 deltas and to more than 70\% of the flood-exposed population for 3 deltas. The magnitude of the nature-based mitigation, estimated as the length of the storm surge pathway crossing through tidal wetlands, was found to be significantly correlated to the total wetland area within a delta. This highlights the importance of conserving extensive continuous tidal wetlands as a nature-based approach to mitigate flood risks. Our analysis further reveals that deltas with limited historical wetland reclamation and therefore large remaining wetlands, such as the Mississippi, the Niger, and part of the Ganges-Brahmaputra deltas, benefit from investing in the conservation of their vast wetlands, while deltas with extensive historical wetland reclamation, such as the Yangtze and Rhine deltas, may improve the sustainability of flood protection programs by combining existing hard engineering with new nature-based solutions through restoration of former wetlands.},

            Mangroves are amongst the most productive marine ecosystems on Earth, providing a unique habitat opportunity for many species and key goods and services for human beings. Mangrove habitats are regressing at an alarming rate, due to direct anthropogenic impacts and global change. Here, in order to assess the effects of mangrove habitat degradation on benthic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, we investigated meiofaunal biodiversity (as proxy of benthic biodiversity), benthic biomass and prokaryotic heterotrophic production (as proxies of ecosystem functioning) and trophic state in a disturbed and an undisturbed mangrove forests. We report here that disturbed mangrove area showed a loss of 20\% of benthic biodiversity, with the local extinction of four Phyla (Cladocera, Kynorincha, Priapulida, Tanaidacea), a loss of 80\% of microbial-mediated decomposition rates, of the benthic biomass and of the trophic resources. The results of this study strengthen the need to preserve mangrove forests and to restore those degraded to guarantee the provision of goods and services needed to support the biodiversity and functioning of wide portions of tropical ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Mangroves are disappearing rapidly worldwide despite their well documented biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide. Failure to link ecological processes and their societal benefits has favored highly destructive aquaculture and tourism developments that threaten mangroves and result in costly “externalities.” Specifically, the potentially irreparable damage to fisheries because of mangrove loss has been belittled and is greatly underestimated. Here, we show that, in the Gulf of California, fisheries landings are positively related to the local abundance of mangroves and, in particular, to the productive area in the mangrove–water fringe that is used as nursery and/or feeding grounds by many commercial species. Mangrove-related fish and crab species account for 32\% of the small-scale fisheries landings in the region. The annual economic median value of these fisheries is US \$37,500 per hectare of mangrove fringe, falling within the higher end of values previously calculated worldwide for all mangrove services together. The ten-year discounted value of one hectare of fringe is {\textgreater}300 times the official cost set by the Mexican government. The destruction of mangroves has a strong economic impact on local fishing communities and on food production in the region. Our valuation of the services provided by mangroves may prove useful in making appropriate decisions for a more efficient and sustainable use of wetlands.},

	abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems are threatened by climate change. We review the state of knowledge of mangrove vulnerability and responses to predicted climate change and consider adaptation options. Based on available evidence, of all the climate change outcomes, relative sea-level rise may be the greatest threat to mangroves. Most mangrove sediment surface elevations are not keeping pace with sea-level rise, although longer term studies from a larger number of regions are needed. Rising sea-level will have the greatest impact on mangroves experiencing net lowering in sediment elevation, where there is limited area for landward migration. The Paciﬁc Islands mangroves have been demonstrated to be at high risk of substantial reductions. There is less certainty over other climate change outcomes and mangrove responses. More research is needed on assessment methods and standard indicators of change in response to effects from climate change, while regional monitoring networks are needed to observe these responses to enable educated adaptation. Adaptation measures can offset anticipated mangrove losses and improve resistance and resilience to climate change. Coastal planning can adapt to facilitate mangrove migration with sea-level rise. Management of activities within the catchment that affect long-term trends in the mangrove sediment elevation, better management of other stressors on mangroves, rehabilitation of degraded mangrove areas, and increases in systems of strategically designed protected area networks that include mangroves and functionally linked ecosystems through representation, replication and refugia, are additional adaptation options.},

	abstract = {This review assesses the degree of resilience of mangrove forests to large, infrequent disturbance (tsunamis) and their role in coastal protection, and to chronic disturbance events (climate change) and the future of mangroves in the face of global change. From a geological perspective, mangroves come and go at considerable speed with the current distribution of forests a legacy of the Holocene, having undergone almost chronic disturbance as a result of ﬂuctuations in sea-level. Mangroves have demonstrated considerable resilience over timescales commensurate with shoreline evolution. This notion is supported by evidence that soil accretion rates in mangrove forests are currently keeping pace with mean sea-level rise. Further support for their resilience comes from patterns of recovery from natural disturbances (storms, hurricanes) which coupled with key life history traits, suggest pioneer-phase characteristics. Stand composition and forest structure are the result of a complex interplay of physiological tolerances and competitive interactions leading to a mosaic of interrupted or arrested succession sequences, in response to physical/chemical gradients and landform changes. The extent to which some or all of these factors come into play depends on the frequency, intensity, size, and duration of the disturbance. Mangroves may in certain circumstances offer limited protection from tsunamis; some models using realistic forest variables suggest signiﬁcant reduction in tsunami wave ﬂow pressure for forests at least 100 m in width. The magnitude of energy absorption strongly depends on tree density, stem and root diameter, shore slope, bathymetry, spectral characteristics of incident waves, and tidal stage upon entering the forest. The ultimate disturbance, climate change, may lead to a maximum global loss of 10e15\% of mangrove forest, but must be considered of secondary importance compared with current average annual rates of 1e2\% deforestation. A large reservoir of below-ground nutrients, rapid rates of nutrient ﬂux and microbial decomposition, complex and highly efﬁcient biotic controls, selfdesign and redundancy of keystone species, and numerous feedbacks, all contribute to mangrove resilience to various types of disturbance.},

	abstract = {Mangroves are deﬁned by the presence of trees that mainly occur in the intertidal zone, between land and sea, in the (sub) tropics. The intertidal zone is characterised by highly variable environmental factors, such as temperature, sedimentation and tidal currents. The aerial roots of mangroves partly stabilise this environment and provide a substratum on which many species of plants and animals live. Above the water, the mangrove trees and canopy provide important habitat for a wide range of species. These include birds, insects, mammals and reptiles. Below the water, the mangrove roots are overgrown by epibionts such as tunicates, sponges, algae, and bivalves. The soft substratum in the mangroves forms habitat for various infaunal and epifaunal species, while the space between roots provides shelter and food for motile fauna such as prawns, crabs and ﬁshes. Mangrove litter is transformed into detritus, which partly supports the mangrove food web. Plankton, epiphytic algae and microphytobenthos also form an important basis for the mangrove food web. Due to the high abundance of food and shelter, and low predation pressure, mangroves form an ideal habitat for a variety of animal species, during part or all of their life cycles. As such, mangroves may function as nursery habitats for (commercially important) crab, prawn and ﬁsh species, and support offshore ﬁsh populations and ﬁsheries. Evidence for linkages between mangroves and offshore habitats by animal migrations is still scarce, but highly needed for management and conservation purposes. Here, we ﬁrstly reviewed the habitat function of mangroves by common taxa of terrestrial and marine animals. Secondly, we reviewed the literature with regard to the degree of interlinkage between mangroves and adjacent habitats, a research area which has received increasing attention in the last decade. Finally, we reviewed current insights into the degree to which mangrove litter fuels the mangrove food web, since this has been the subject of longstanding debate.},

Furthermore, according to a back-ofthe-envelope calculation, the potential economic value of mangrove conservation, estimated in terms of fishery production reached 22,861 US\$/hectare/year.

The purpose of this study is to calculate ﬁsheries degradation rate to show the resource exploitation trend in Indonesian small-scale ﬁsheries. We focus on small-scale ﬁsheries that use hook and line and gillnet to catch Eastern little tuna, Skipjack tuna, Red snappers, Blue line sea bass, and Halibut. The ﬁsheries degradation rate shows the ﬁsh resources depletion caused by ﬁshing. The ﬁsheries degradation rate had trend to reach the threshold score with the average coefﬁcient of 0.33 in ten years. This means that Indonesian small-scale ﬁsheries lead to high ﬁsh exploitation. We recommend that the Indonesian government improve regulation of the small-scale ﬁshing activities by limiting the ﬁshing days and gears used, so the activities become sustainable.},
