# MAKING VARIABLES ----------------------------------------------------------------

# VARIABLES ARE CASE-SENSITIVE! Show how this makes two different variables
nama1 <- "Sophie"
NAMA1<- "Rina"

NAMA1 <- "BEN" # THIS WILL REWRITE OVER THE VARIABLE AND SAVE NEW INFORMATION

# YOU CAN ASSIGN A NUMBER TO A VARIABLE 
x <- 4
y <- 17

x*y

# YOU CAN CREATE A VAIRABLE FROM OTHER VARIABLES
z <- x * y
z


# COMBINE WORDS THAT ARE VARIABLES
Negara <- "Amerika"
Umur <- 27

# THE FUNCTION PASTE ALLOWS YOU TO PRINT WORDS. MUST USE COMMAS IN BETWEEN WORDS AND VARIABLES

paste("Hello world. My name is", nama1, "I am from", Negara, "I am", Umur, "years old")

# DATA TYPES -----------------------------------------------------------

## NUMERIC - DO NOT USE QUOTATION MARKS FOR NUMERIC DATA

2 + 3

# DIVISION
94729 / 7

# INTEGER DIVISION
94729 %/% 7

# MODULAR ARITHMETIC - show on whiteboard what this is
94729 %% 7

# YOU CAN ALSO USE PARENTHESES IN THE SAME WAY THEY ARE USED IN MATHEMATICS

7 * 2 + 3

7 * (2 + 3)


## ACTIVITY 
# GO INTO GROUPS AND TAKE TURNS ONE PERSON SAYING AN EQUATION AND EVERYONE TYPING OUT TO CALCULATE THE ANSWER (CHALLENGE: TRY TO USE INTEGER DIVISION, ARITHMETIC, AND VARIABLES IN YOUR CALCULATIONS)

# STRINGS

# ALWAYS USE QUOTATION MARKS. CANNOT PERFORM CALCULATIONS ON STRINGS
