 Keywords: WRITE KEYWORDS HERE

# THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A NEW HEADER

## THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A SUB HEADER

THIS IS HOW YOU WRITE NORMAL TEXT (NO # SIGN). THIS IS WHERE YOU DO YOUR NORMAL WRITING. YOU CAN REFERENCE FIGURES BY (Figure \@ref(fig:NAMECODECHUNK)). Every code chunk needs to have a different name.


<!-- IN ORDER TO MAKE A REFERENCE, YOU MUST WRITE [@BibtexCODEFORREFERENCE].  -->

```{r NAMECODECHUNK, fig.cap = 'CHANGE FIGURE CAPTION HERE'}

plot(x = mtcars$mpg, y = mtcars$qsec)

#THIS IS CALLED A CODE CHUNK, WHERE YOU WRITE R, TO MAKE A NEW CODE CHUNK, COPY THIS WHOLE CODE CHUNK. EACH CODE CHUNK MUST HAVE A DIFFERENT NAME


```


THIS IS MY NEW FIGURE (Figure\@ref(fig:NEWCODECHUNK))

```{r NEWCODECHUNK, fig.cap = 'THI IS JUST AN EXAMPLE PLOT'}

plot(x = 1:10, Y = 1:10)

#THIS IS CALLED A CODE CHUNK, WHERE YOU WRITE R, TO MAKE A NEW CODE CHUNK, COPY THIS WHOLE CODE CHUNK. EACH CODE CHUNK MUST HAVE A DIFFERENT NAME


```

```{r ADDDOWNLOADEDFIGURE, fig.cap = 'DOWNLOADED FIGURE'}

#UNCOMMENT OUT THE BELOW LINE
#knitr::include_graphics("INSERT FILE PATH TO DOWNLOADED FIGURE HERE.PNG OR .JPEG DEPENDING ON WHAT THE FILETYPE")
