EQUATIONS:
Each person take turns saying an equation and everyone type it out (Challenge, try to used pembagian utuh and artimatika modular, and variables in your challenges)

VARIABLES (strings):
Work in groups to come up with a fake character, but change the information based off of your own ideas using variables and print the results


NAMA <- "Sophie"
UMUR <- 27
SUADARA <- 6
NAMABAPAK <- "Tony"
NAMAIBU <- "Gretchen"


Contoh: "Nama saya", NAMA, "umur saya, " UMUR, "Saya bersuadara " SUADARA, "Nama bapak dan ibuku" NAMABAPAK, "dan", NAMAIBU.

LISTS AND DATAFRAMES:
First go through this example, you forgot to mention nested lists
https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/07/how-to-subset-list-objects-in-r/
BASICALLY THE SAME AS A DATA FRAME, EXCEPT STRUCTURE. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE R OUTPUT COME UP AS A LIST SOMETIMES, NOT A DF SO JUST KNOWING HOW TO USE AND SUBSET

Practice: 
Write an empty dataframe
Write dataframe that has lists of your classes, the number of students in each class, what day of the week that class is, and how many credits that class is
Extract each column of that dataframe
Extract the first two rows of that dataframe
Extract the 3rd and 5th rows with 1st and 3rd columns from a given data frame.
Add a column saying what time each class is
Add a row of a made up class you'd like to take
Show me the list of classes in alphabetical order

(Another good practice example) https://www.w3resource.com/r-programming-exercises/dataframe/index.php

IF STATEMENTS:
write a nested if statement that checks if a number x is positive, negative, or 0
Write an if statement that checks if a number is divisible by 2, 3, or both
Write a while loop that prints every multple of 9 until 900

FUNCTIONS
Create a function that will return the sum of 2 integers.
Create a function that will return T or F if a number is divisible by 7
Create a function that will turn all numbers into positive, whole numbers
