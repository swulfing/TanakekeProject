EQUATIONS:
Each person take turns saying an equation and everyone type it out (Challenge, try to used pembagian utuh and artimatika modular, and variables in your challenges)

VARIABLES (strings):
Work in groups to come up with a fake character, but change the information based off of your own ideas using variables and print the results


NAMA <- "Sophie"
UMUR <- 27
SUADARA <- 6
NAMABAPAK <- "Tony"
NAMAIBU <- "Gretchen"

MADLIBS: Get in pairs and write a funny story but leave out nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Have the other person fill in the nouns, verbs, and adjectives to write a unique story.

ADJECTIVE1
NAME
PLACE
GAME
ADJECTIVE2
NOUN


A vacation is when you take a trip to some ADJECTIVE1 place with your ADJECTIVE2 family. Usually you go to some place that is near a NOUN1 or on a NOUN2. A good vacation is wehre you can ride PLURALNOUN1 or play GAME or go hunting for PLURALNOUN2. I like to spend my time INGVERB1 or INGVERB2. When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating three PLURALNOUN3, and fathers play golf, and mothers sit around INGVERB2. Last summer, my brother fell off a NOUN3 and got poison PLANT all over his BODYPART. My family is going to go to the PLACE and I will practice INGVERB3. Parents need ADJECTIVE3 and because they have to work NUMBER hours every day all year making enough PLURALNOUN4 to pay for the vacation.


Contoh: "Nama saya", NAMA, "umur saya, " UMUR, "Saya bersuadara " SUADARA, "Nama bapak dan ibuku" NAMABAPAK, "dan", NAMAIBU.

LISTS AND DATAFRAMES:
Lists:

Make a list of all the odd numbers from 1-100
Make a list of all the numbers divisible by 7 from 1-1000

Run the code and write what each of these do:
	buah[1]
	buah[1:3]
	buah[c(1,3, 5)]
	buah[-2]
Make a list of your favorite movies or tv shows (in order most to least favorite)
Print for me your top 3 favorite
Check to see if the movie "Batman" is included
Add your least favorite movie to the end


First go through this example, you forgot to mention nested lists
https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/07/how-to-subset-list-objects-in-r/
BASICALLY THE SAME AS A DATA FRAME, EXCEPT STRUCTURE. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE R OUTPUT COME UP AS A LIST SOMETIMES, NOT A DF SO JUST KNOWING HOW TO USE AND SUBSET

Practice: 
Write an empty dataframe
Write dataframe that has lists of your classes, the number of students in each class, what day of the week that class is, and how many credits that class is
Add a column on the left that numbers the classes starting from 1
Extract each column of that dataframe
Extract the first two rows of that dataframe
Extract the 3rd and 5th rows with 1st and 3rd columns from a given data frame.
Add a column saying what time each class is
Add a row of a made up class you'd like to take
Show me the list of classes in alphabetical order

(Another good practice example) https://www.w3resource.com/r-programming-exercises/dataframe/index.php

IF STATEMENTS:
write a nested if statement that checks if a number x is positive, negative, or 0
Write an if statement that checks if a number is divisible by 2, 3, or both
Use a while loop to investigate the number of terms required before the product 1⋅2⋅3⋅4⋅…reaches above 10 million. print the number of terms required

FOR LOOP
Loop through the dataframe you made last time and print out each of your classes
Loop through 100 random flips of a coin and at the end of the loop, count how many times each was heads and tails. Use the code below to simulate a coin flip
		coin <- c('heads', 'tails') #write two options for coin flip
		sample(coin, size = 1) #Take a random subset

FUNCTIONS
Create a function that will return the sum of 2 integers.
Create a function that will return T or F if a number is divisible by 17
Create a function that will turn all numbers into positive, whole numbers
Create a guess the number game. The function will randomly generate a number between one and 100. Then, two players will input their guesses. The closest player wins!
