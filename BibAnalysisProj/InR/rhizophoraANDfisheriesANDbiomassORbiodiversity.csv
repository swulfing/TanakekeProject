On all sampling occasions replicate samples were taken on two consecutive nights. In all, 3320 fish were collected, representing 42 species and weighing 141 498 g. Significantly fewer fish were caught on the second night than on the first night. Economically important fish of the Families Atherinidae, Mugilidae, Gerreidae, Sparidae and Sillaginidae represented >76% by number and >74% of the total weight caught. The mean density of fish in the forest was 0.04 ± 0.01 m-2, with a biomass of 1.3 ± 0.2 g m-2. This is lower than that found in similar studies on other mangrove communities. The fish community was dominated by detritivores and intermediate carnivores, many of which are of economic value. Although the fish use of this subtropical R. stylosa forest was low, this habitat is important as a feeding and nursery area for fish species that contribute to the fisheries value of the region.","","Australia, Queensland, Tin Can Bay; Rhizophora stylosa; Atherinidae; Gerreidae; Mugilidae; Rhizophora stylosa; Rhizophoraceae; Sillaginidae; Sparidae; biomass; community structure; density; mangrove swamps; subtropical forest","","","","","","","Bell J.D., Pollard D.A., Burchmore J.J., Pease B.C., Middleton M.J., Structure of a fish community in a temperate tidal mangrove creek in Botany Bay, New South Wales, Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 35, pp. 33-46, (1984); Blaber S.J.M., Blaber T.G., Factors affecting the distribution of juvenile estuarine and inshore fish, Journal of Fish Biology, 17, pp. 143-162, (1980); Blaber S.J.M., Milton D.A., Species composition, community structure and zoogeography of fishes of mangrove estuaries in the Solomon Islands, Marine Biology (Berlin), 105, pp. 259-267, (1990); Blaber S.J.M., Young J.W., Dunning M.C., Community structure and zoogeographic affinities of the coastal fishes of the Dampier region of north-western Australia, Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 36, pp. 247-266, (1985); Burchmore J., Management of the estuarine habitat, Proceedings of the Australian Society of Fish Biology Workshop, pp. 184-187, (1993); Hyland S.J., Butler C.T., The Distribution and Modification of Mangroves and Saltmarsh-claypans in Southern Queensland, (1988); Kay G., Fishermen recognise 1989 as 'year of the environment, The Queensland Fisherman, 7, 5, pp. 23-26, (1989); Kjelson M.A., Colby D.R., The evaluation and use of gear efficiencies in the estimation of estuarine fish abundance, Estuarine Processes, 2, pp. 416-424, (1977); Morton R.M., Community structure, density and standing crop of fishes in a subtropical Australian mangrove system, Marine Biology (Berlin), 105, pp. 385-394, (1990); Morton R.M., Pollock B.R., Beumer J.P., The occurrence and diet of fishes in a tidal inlet to a saltmarsh in southern Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australian Journal of Ecology, 12, pp. 217-237, (1987); Pielou E.C., Shannon's formula as a measure of specific diversity: Its use and misuse, The American Naturalist, 100, pp. 463-465, (1969); Poiner I.R., Conacher C.A., Staples D.J., Moriarty D.J.W., Seagrasses - Why are they important?, Moreton Bay in the Balance, pp. 41-53, (1992); Robertson A.I., Blaber S.J.M., Plankton, epibenthos and fish communities, Coastal and Estuarine Studies No 41.

There are many biodiversity values of mangrove ecosystems that it can be evaluated economically. This study aims to: (i) identify the species diversity of mangrove forest; (ii) analyze the mangrove productivity and aboveground biomass; (iii) analyze the ecosystem value of mangrove forest in Mentawir Village, Penajam Paser District, East Kalimantan Province. The research used systematic random sampling method by establishing two plots with extent of one hectare for each plot in which each plot was divided into 20m x 20m subplots. The volume and mean annual increment (MAI), as well as current annual increment (CAI), were calculated. Economic value of mangrove ecosystem was calculated using Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) to reveal the total margin between Willingness to Pay (WTP) of wood produced by mangrove forest and Willingness to Accept (WTA) of fisheries catches. The results showed that there were 12 species of mangroves in the studied areas in which Rhizophora apiculata was the dominant species. Total aboveground biomass in Plot I and Plot II were respectively 127.46 tons ha-1 (62.61 tons C ha-1) and 79.26 (38.85 tons C ha-1) and dominated by Rhizophoraceace family with 76.80%, while 23.22% of the biomass was contributed by other mangrove families. The mangrove forest had a maximum average volume increment at 48 years and 42 years with MAI of 2.97 ha-1yr-1and 2.12 m3 ha-1yr-1 at Plot I and Plot II, respectively, with the total volume reached 127.5 m3 ha-1 and 79.60 m3 ha-1. The calculation of total margin between WTP and WTA indicated that in economic value of mangrove ecosystem in Mentawir Village with an extent of 2,300 ha was between IDR 207,000,000 yr-1 and IDR 345,000,000 yr-1. Our findings suggest that a good mangrove ecosystem will result in high economic value and biodiversity values cannot be separated from economic benefits in order to protect its sustainability. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Although mangrove litter is thought to represent an important input of organic matter and nutrients to the coastal aquatic systems, the factors determining the quality and size of this litter flux have not been studied so far. We monitored leaf, stipule, twig, and reproductive litter monthly in monocultures of Rhizophora apiculata mangrove forests of 7, 11, 17 and 24 years old in the Camau province, Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Litter traps were used to measure litter fall production from June 2001 till May 2002. Total litter fall was in the range of 8.86-14.16 t DW ha-1 year-1. Leaves were the main component, and represented 70% of litter fall production in all stands. Total litter fall was lower in the older stands but the amount of reproductive litter was significantly higher in these stands (17 and 24 years). Biomass of leaf litter was highest between the end of the wet season and the beginning of the dry season. Phosphorus and nitrogen levels in leaf litter were significantly higher in younger than in older stands. Overall, our study indicated that young stands produced the highest input of litter and particularly of nitrogen and phosphorus to the surrounding aquatic system. Consequently, these stands contribute significantly to the fisheries. © Springer 2005.","Biomass; Mangrove; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Vietnam","Asia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam; World; Rhizophora apiculata; aquatic ecosystem; leaf litter; mangrove; swamp","","","","","Netherlands Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education, Nuffic","This research was a part of the MHO-8 project for Environmental Management of Coastal Resources in the Mekong Delta, a co-operative project be- tween Wageningen University, The Netherlands and Can Tho University, Vietnam.

Fringing reefs almost completely surround the volcanic island, enclosing a series of lagoons of variable depths (1-4 m). Tides are not important but wave heights can reach 3 m. The zonation of lagoons in a transect from the beach towards the open sea is given, together with the zonal distribution of the flora and fauna, the types of corals and sediments, the detrital sediment composition, the different hydrodynamic processes acting on the benthic sediments, as well as the geochemical (redox) processes. Commercial exploitation of the lagoonal fisheries and other anthropogenic factors have contributed to reef stress and degradation. A rich algal biomass is present which shows seasonal variation. Two species of mangroves, Rhizophora mucronata and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza exist. Fish and shellfish culture is practised in enclosed ponds (barachois). © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","biota; coral reefs; lagoons; mangroves; sediment processes","Mauritius; algae; Anthozoa; Bruguiera gymnorrhiza; Mauritius; Rhizophora mucronata; Rhizophoraceae; coastal ecosystem; lagoon; mangrove; reef","","","","","","","Baxter A.N., Geochemistry and petrogenesis of primitive alkali basalt from Mauritius, Indian Ocean, Geol.

Mangrove ecosystems provide natural habitat for a wide variety of flora and fauna, whilst the economic contribution by mangroves for tourism, fisheries and other natural resources is also of paramount importance. This study focusses on the biodiversity of four major regions of Indian mangroves, namely, Bhitarkanika (Odisha), Pichavaram (Tamil Nadu), Chorao Islands (Goa) and Porlob Jig (Andaman and Nicobar Islands). The study aims to monitor the present status of mangroves in Southern and Eastern coasts of India, with the synergistic use of optical and SAR data. The aerial extents of all the Dominant vegetation spatial maps generated revealed that the Bhitarkanika mangroves had the largest extent (14425 ha) among the four mangrove regions. The second largest area recorded was by the Porlob Jig mangroves of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (9972 ha), followed by the Pichavaram mangroves (788 ha) and the mangroves of Chorao Islands of Goa (603 ha). Decision makers, for taking the necessary conservation and management actions to protect these fragile, vital habitats can ultimately use this data.Key policy insights This paper provides an insight into the major mangrove species of India. It gives a detailed account of the varying mangrove biodiversity in the Eastern and Western coast of India. The prevalence of various kinds of mangroves from different ecosystems were documented. Among these, Rhizophora annamalayana specious was found indigenously in Tamil Nadu. © 2021 Biodiversity Conservancy International.","biodiversity; Indian mangroves; LISS-IV; phytosociological assessment; Resourcesat-2 LISS-III; SAR data; spectral indices","","","","","","Central Island Agricultural Research Institute; Port Blair; Shri Tapan Misra; Indian Council of Agricultural Research, ICAR","The authors are extremely grateful to Shri Tapan Misra, Director, Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad, for his keen interest and for providing the facilities during the execution of the project.

Therefore, this study was carried out to assess the biodiversity of flora and fauna in the Riau Coastline mangrove ecosystem and its impacts on local communities. The transect was performed to identify soil conditions, distribution, and the dominance of flora species, while field observations and interviews with residents were conducted to determine the presence of fauna and discover the ecosystem’s benefit to the local community's economy. Based on the results, Rhizophora mucronata and Rhizophora apiculata has the highest relative dominance (RDC) and important value index in all observed stations. On the other hand, the fish/water biota species has the highest diversity and have economic that mostly serve as a catch for local fishermen. Ecotourism is also encouraged to boost the community's economy and aid ecological learning for sustainability purposes. The mangrove ecosystem's existence remains sustainable because fisheries are the main commodity, however, logging is less desirable as a source of income. © 2021 WITPress.

In addition, they provide typical forest goods such as timber and firewood; harvesting these can cause forest degradation and loss. In Kenya, a large proportion of the rural population cook using firewood on traditional, inefficient three-stone fires. Although harvesting mangrove wood is illegal, the high poverty rate, absence of alternative fuels and lack of law enforcement mean it is likely to remain widespread, with consequent pressure on the forests. The use of three-stone fires has been associated with high levels of indoor air pollution, causing adverse health impacts. The current project aimed to determine a baseline of wood usage and health burden caused by indoor air pollution at a mangrove dependent community in Gazi Bay, southern Kenya. Basic information about fuel usage and perceived health problems related to indoor air pollution was collected using a questionnaire. Wood usage patterns were recorded for 28 days to establish the average daily wood consumption and main species used. Passive diffusion tubes were used to assess CO concentrations over 24 hours. Particulate pollution for the size fraction PM2.5 was measured during cooking using a DustTrak aerosol monitor. Mean daily per capita wood consumption was 1.2 kg although this varied significantly depending on household size, with larger households using less per capita wood. The mangrove Rhizophora mucronata made up 10% of wood used and people spent, on average, 22 hours per month collecting wood. The mean 24-hour CO concentration was 5.9ppm. The average level of PM2.5 during cooking was 10 mg/m3 respectively. Chronic exposure at those levels is expected to cause significant health impacts of the kinds indicated by symptoms reported from the questionnaires. Improved cookstove introduction in Gazi is recommended as feasible as participants showed not only interest in improved cookstoves and awareness of the health implications from indoor air pollution, but also were willing to invest financially in improved cookstoves. © The Author(s) 2018.","Air pollution; Biomass fuel use; Carbon monoxide; Improved cookstoves; Mangroves; Particulate matter","","","","","","British Council Newton Fund, (275670159)","This work was funded by a grant from the British Council Newton Fund (grant no. 275670159).","Badamassi A., Xu D., Leyla B., The impact of residential combustion emissions on health expenditures: Empirical evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa, Atmosphere, 8, 9, (2017); Bailis R., Edwards R., Kitchen Performance Test (KPT) Version 3.0., (2007); Bailis R., Ezzati M., Kammen D., Greenhouse gas implications of household energy technology in Kenya, Environmental Science and Technology, 37, 10, pp. 2051-2059, (2003); Belkin H., Chapter 16-Environmental Human Health Issues Related to Indoor Air Pollution from Domestic Biomass Use in Rural China: A Review.

Tree density was 3,203 trees ha-1 and basal area was 14.0 m2 ha-1. Litterfall was 1,417 g m-2 yr-1, characteristic of a productive riverine forest. The degradation constant for Laguncularia racemosa leaves varied from 1.71 to 4.7 yr-1 and mean annual net aquatic productivity was 0.41 g C m-3 d-1. There were high concentrations of humic substances (up to 150 mg l-1) early in the wet season. Seasonal variations of the above parameters seemed closely related to the ecology of fish populations. There were 75 fish species distributed in two principal assemblages associated with wet and dry seasons. Diversity and biomass analysis indicated 18 dominant species. Total biomass of the community in this coastal system was estimated at 10 g wet wt m-2. The highest biomass occurred in the wet season. The most common fish species were Mugil curema, Achirus mazatlanus, Galeichthys caerulescens, Arius liropus, Diapterus peruvianus, Lile stolifera, Centropomus robalito, and Eucinostomus sp., all of which have fishery importance. Primary productivity and fish community ecology are controlled by habitat characteristics, river discharge, and climatic seasonality. © 1990 Estuarine Research Federation.","","Mexico, Teacapan-Agua Brava; fish community; lagoon; mangrove; primary productivity","","","","","","","Alvarez-Rubio M., Amezcua-Linares F., Yanez-Arancibia A., Ecología y estructura de la comunidad de peces en el sistema Lagunar Teacapán-Agua Brava.

However, over the last two decades harvesting of mangrove forests has been extensive with effects on mangrove biodiversity and ecosystem services. We investigate the effect of mangrove harvesting on tree biodiversity in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using two line transects each in ten mangrove forests, mangrove composition, species dominance, density, frequency, coverage, and stem diameter and diversity were recorded. Interviews detailing provisioning ecosystem services were also conducted with local forestry and fishery workers to determine the level of exploitation. Ten mangrove species were recorded (Avicennia alba, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Ceriops tagal, Excoecaria agallocha, Lumnitzera racemosa, Nypa fruticans, Rhizophora apiculata, Rhizophora mucronata, Rhizophora stylosa, and Sonneratia alba) belonging to six families (Avicenniaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Combretaceae, Arecaceae and Sonneratiaceae). Mangrove forests are now dominated by saplings and seedlings, with few trees above 15 cm diameter at breast height. Rhizophora sp. were found to be the most important and dominant species. Rhizophora sp. was the most widely used as it was deemed the most suitable for firewood and charcoal. In addition, it is the main species planted in mangrove restoration projects, which have focused on establishing production forest rather than restoring natural species composition and structure. Despite the decrease in biodiversity, the mangroves still provide a wide range of ecosystem services to the communities in the area. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Biodiversity; Ecosystem service; Indonesia; Mangrove forests; Sulawesi","Greater Sunda Islands; Indonesia; Sulawesi; Sunda Isles; Acanthaceae; Arecaceae; Avicennia alba; Bruguiera gymnorhiza; Ceriops tagal; Combretaceae; Euphorbiaceae; Excoecaria agallocha; Lumnitzera racemosa; Lythraceae; Nypa fruticans; Rhizophora; Rhizophora apiculata; Rhizophora mucronata; Rhizophora stylosa; Rhizophoraceae; Sonneratia alba; biodiversity; coastal zone; community composition; ecosystem service; harvesting; mangrove; transect","","","","","Department of Geography; Department of Geosciences and Natural Resources Management, University of Copenhagen; Directorate of Higher Education, Ministry of Education and Culture; Government of South Sulawesi and Takalar District; State University of Makassar","We would like to thank the Directorate of Higher Education, Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia, which has financially supported this research in collaboration with the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resources Management, University of Copenhagen.

However, most of the mangrove wetlands structural and functional information useful to evaluate the quality, quantity and monetary value of its ESs has been obtained from studies at tropical latitudes usually dominated by large deltas and extensive coastal lagoon and estuaries. Thus, there is a major data gap for mangrove wetlands located in arid and semi-arid regions due to their limited land cover and location at the boundary of transitional climate gradients. Here we analyze the spatial distribution of mangrove wetlands carbon stocks and net primary productivity (i.e., litterfall and root productivity) in La Paz Bay, an arid coastal region in the Gulf of California, Mexico, where mangrove wetlands are spatially distributed in conspicuously extensive patches. We used this information to qualitatively rank ESs. Three peri-urban mangrove wetland sites (Balandra, Enfermeria, and Zacatecas) were characterized by different degrees of anthropogenic impact. Aboveground biomass (interval: 13.6 to 31.6 Mg C ha−1) was in the lower range when compared globally. The average C storage in mangrove soils (at 45 cm depth) in La Paz Bay is 175 Mg C ha−1, which is higher than the values reported for other arid zones (≥1 m soil depth: 43–156 Mg C ha−1). Belowground root biomass and productivity values (roots range: 0.22–0.31 Mg C ha−1; fine roots NPP: 0.06–0.09 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) were in the lower range. We found distinct differences in aboveground C storage values among sites where mangrove species formed monospecific stands across the landscape within each site. Areas dominated by the species Rhizophora mangle reflected the highest soil C density values (208.9 ± 144.6 Mg C ha−1), followed by Laguncularia racemosa (181.4 ± 118.2 Mg C ha−1) and Avicennia germinans (155.5 ± 72.1 Mg C ha−1). We identified ESs provided by each of the sites, including both cultural (i.e., ecotourism; especially in Balandra), and provisioning (fisheries) services. Our study is a first step in the quantitative assessment of functional and structural properties as ESs of arid mangrove wetlands in La Paz Bay that could be readily translated into robust economic estimates for this arid coastal region. © 2019","Anthropogenic impact; Biomass; Blue carbon; Ecosystem services; Peri-urban mangroves; Structural properties","Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystems; Food Storage; Water Quality; Wetlands; Baja California Sur; La Paz Bay; Mexico [North America]; Zacatecas; Avicennia germinans; Laguncularia racemosa; Rhizophora mangle; Rhizophoraceae; Arid regions; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon capture; Coastal zones; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Food storage; Soils; Spatial distribution; Structural properties; Urban growth; Water quality; Wetlands; Anthropogenic impacts; Arid and semi-arid regions; Ecosystem services; Functional information; Laguncularia racemosa; Net primary productivity; Peri-urban mangroves; Quantitative assessments; anthropogenic effect; arid region; belowground biomass; biological production; carbon sequestration; coastal erosion; coastal lagoon; ecosystem service; environmental gradient; mangrove; periurban area; semiarid region; urban system; wetland; Forestry","","","","","US National Science Foundation-FCE-LTER program; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DEB-1237517); U.S. Department of the Interior, DOI, (#G12AC00002); Department of the Interior Southeast Climate Science Center, SE CSC, (12AC00002); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT, (388919); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONCYT; Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, FONACYT","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the Mexican Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT) agency through a research grant to ESZ and SELlC and a doctoral scholarship to JGOG (grant # 388919).

Additionally, sex- and size composition of the commercial catch and catch per unit of effort (CPUE - the number of crabs captured per fisherman per day) were monitored between 1997 and 2003. Average and maximum crab sizes (carapace width, CW) from all three sampling sites combined were 6.1 cm and 8.8 cm in males, respectively, and 5.5 and 7.3 cm in females. Crabs were largest at the site that had been reportedly less exploited in the past. The overall sex ratio was skewed towards males (53-62%). Egg carrying females were only encountered during the rainy season. Mean crab abundance and biomass was 1.7 specimens m -2 and 142 g m-2 fresh mass. Only large males were commercially harvested (98% > 6.5 cm CW). Their biomass was 53 g m -2 and the Caeté estuary yields an annual production of 1200 t of these large specimens. This is approximately the quantity that is currently being harvested. CPUE was similar in 1997 and 1998, then decreased by 15% until 2000 and stabilized for the rest of the study period. Mean capture size (cm CW) ranged between 7.2 ± 0.5 and 7.5 ± 0.2 and was above the size of 50% (and even 100%) male maturity and the legal minimum capture size. There is no evidence that the Caeté crab population is overfished, despite over 30 years of de facto open access exploitation. Apparently, the selectivity of fishermen and consumers for large male crabs as well as the local artisanal capture techniques are key factors in preventing an overfishing of the Caeté crab population until today. Our results suggest that the economic and social sustainability of this fishery will be affected well before the biological one, which should be considered in the recently proposed coastal co-management plan for the region. © EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD 2005.","Artisanal fisheries; Biomass; Brazil; CPUE; Management; Mangrove crab; Sex ratio; Ucides cordatus","Brazil; Caete Estuary; Para [Brazil]; South America; Western Hemisphere; World; Rhizophora mangle; Scylla; Ucides cordatus; fishery management; population structure","","","","","","","Alcantara-Filho P., Contribuição ao estudo da biologia e ecologia do caranguejo-uçá, Ucides cordatus cordatus (Linnaeus, 1763) (Crustacea, Decapoda, Brachyura), no manguezal do Rio Ceará (Brasil), Arq.

It has an extension of about 220 km2 and is subjected to a considerable human impact through intensive harvest of mangrove crabs (Ucides cordatus) and logging of mangroves. In order to integrate available information on biomass, catches, food spectrum and dynamics of the main species populations of the system, a trophic steady state model of 19 compartments was constructed using the ECOPATH II software (Christensen and Pauly, 1992). Ninety-nine percent of total system biomass is made up by mangroves (Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa), which are assumed to cover about 45% of the total area and contribute about 60% to the system's primary production. The remaining biomass (132 g m-2) is distributed between the pelagic and benthic domains in proportions of 10% and 90% respectively. Through litter fall, mangroves inject the main primary food source into the system, which is either consumed directly by herbivores (principally land crabs, Ucides cordatus) or, when already metabolized by bacteria, by detritivors (principally fiddler crabs, Uca spp.). These two groups are prominent in terms of biomass (80 g and 14·5 g m-2), and food intake (1120 g m-2 yr-1 and 1378 g m-2 yr-1 respectively). According to the model estimates, energy flow through the fish and shrimp compartments is of relatively low importance for the energy cycling within the system, a finding which is contrary to the situation in other mangrove estuaries reported in the literature. The dominance of mangrove epibenthos is attributed to the fact that a large part of the system's production remains within the mangrove forest as material export to the estuary is restricted to spring tides, when the forest is completely indundated. This is also the reason for the low abundance of suspension feeders, which are restricted to a small belt along the Caete River and the small creeks which are watered daily. Phytoplankton, temporarily refloating benthic diatoms, neritic zooplankton and small pelagic fish dominate the (low) pelagic biomass. Total system throughput (10 559 g m-2 yr-1) and mean transfer efficiency between trophic levels (9·8%) calculated by the model fit well into the range reported for other tropical coastal ecosystems. The very high gross efficiency of the fishery (catch/net primary production) of 8·6% and its low trophic level (2·1) is explained by a high harvesting rate of mangroves and the fact that the main animal resource in the system are the mangrove crabs (Ucides cordatus), which feed at the first trophic level. The model was balanced asuming a turnover rate for the land crabs of P/B=0·25 (P/B: production per unit of biomass) which is possibly too high. If this value was replaced by a (possibly more realistic) lower value, the model would not balance, suggesting a situation in which more biomass is being harvested than produced, which hints to an overexploitation of this resource. A ranking of the various system components in terms of their contribution to the system function (ascendency sensu Ulanowicz, 1997) revealed that detritus and associated bacteria contribute 34%, mangroves 19%, fiddler crabs 13%, phytoplankton and microphyto-benthos 10%, mangrove crabs 10%, and the remaining 14 groups 14% to the total ascendency. Summary statistics of the model are given and compared with those of other coastal ecosystems.

Failure to link ecological processes and their societal benefits has favored highly destructive aquaculture and tourism developments that threaten mangroves and result in costly ""externalities."" Specifically, the potentially irreparable damage to fisheries because of mangrove loss has been belittled and is greatly underestimated. Here, we show that, in the Gulf of California, fisheries landings are positively related to the local abundance of mangroves and, in particular, to the productive area in the mangrove-water fringe that is used as nursery and/or feeding grounds by many commercial species. Mangrove-related fish and crab species account for 32% of the small-scale fisheries landings in the region. The annual economic median value of these fisheries is US $37,500 per hectare of mangrove fringe, falling within the higher end of values previously calculated worldwide for all mangrove services together. The ten-year discounted value of one hectare of fringe is >300 times the official cost set by the Mexican government. The destruction of mangroves has a strong economic impact on local fishing communities and on food production in the region. Our valuation of the services provided by mangroves may prove useful in making appropriate decisions for a more efficient and sustainable use of wetlands. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Discounted values; Economic benefits; Ecosystem services; Rhizophora fringe forest; Small-scale fisheries","Angiosperms; Animals; Biomass; Crustacea; Ecosystem; Environment; Fisheries; Fishes; Geography; Mexico; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Trees; Decapoda (Crustacea); Rhizophora; Rhizophoraceae; article; biodiversity; cost; economic aspect; ecosystem; fishing; food industry; government; Gulf stream; mangrove; priority journal; United States","","","","","","","Blaber S.J.M., Mangroves and fishes: Issues of diversity, dependence, and dogma, Bull Mar Sci, 80, pp. 457-472, (2007); Bowman H.H.M., Ecology and physiology of the red mangrove, Proc Am Philos Soc, 56, pp. 589-672, (1917); Mumby P.J., Et al., Mangroves enhance the biomass of coral reef fish communities in the Caribbean, Nature, 427, pp. 533-536, (2004); Dorenbosch M., van Riel M.C., Nagelkerken I., van der Velde G., The relationship of reef fish densities to the proximity of mangrove and seagrass nurseries, Estuar Coast Shelf Sci, 60, pp. 37-48, (2004); Nagelkerken I., Et al., How important are mangroves and seagrass beds for coral-reef fish?

Although successive monitoring of mangrove growth after planting has been conducted in some afforestation stands, measurements of soil environmental changes accompanying plant growth have not been made in most stands. In this study, we observed the interactive relationship between the underground root biomass of mangrove, Rhizophora stylosa, and soil chemical properties at an afforestation stand on Tarawa atoll, Kiribati. Methods: We first estimated underground root biomass in the stand. Next, we measured the concentrations of dissolved phosphorus, nitrogen, and other ions (Br−, Ca2+, K+, Na+, Cl−, and SO42−) in soil pore water, as well as the isotopic ratio of leaf carbon and nitrogen in mangrove patches of different ages. Results: Estimated underground root biomass was positively related with phosphate and nitrate concentrations in soil pore water, indicating the formation of a rhizosphere environment. Leaf δ15N analysis suggested that the discrimination of nitrogen isotopes during nitrification and/or uptake of NH4+ and NO3− occurs in accordance with plant growth. Differences in salt stress among the patches were reflected in leaf δ13C, suggesting it would be a good indicator of the physiological response of mangrove plants to salinity. Conclusions: Our findings revealed the changes that occur on a yearly basis in the chemical properties of mangrove leaves and soil pore water after mangrove plantation. These data help to improve our understanding of environmental succession during the formation of mangrove ecosystems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Nitrification; Phosphorus mobilization; Rhizophora stylosa; Soil pore water; δ<sup>13</sup>C; δ<sup>15</sup>N","Gilbert Islands; Kiribati; Tarawa; isotopic ratio; mangrove; nitrification; physiological response; porewater","","","","","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund Project, (JPMEERF15S11406, JPMEERF20172012); Ministry of Environment, Lands and Agriculture Development, (012/16); Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, ERCA; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (16H04941)","Funding text 1: This work was partly supported by JSPS KAKENHI (grant no. 16H04941) and by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund Project (nos.
