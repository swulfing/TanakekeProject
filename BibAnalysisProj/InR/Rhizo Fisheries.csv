One of the potential area to be developed is Cemara Beach in Pakis District Banyuwangi. This Beach has natural resources in the form of pine area, turtle landing and breeding area, and mangrove forests. Mangrove on Cemara Beach were scattered along the river with 11 species. The purposes of area development are mangrove nursery and processing, managing mangrove area into ecotourism, and sustainable coastal area. The methods of area development was approaching to the community, creating activities by encouraging the people to participate and increasing their knowledge about livelihood, so they can arrange the plans for its implementation. Result of the development is that there are mangrove nurseries for three types namely Sonneratia caseolaris, Avicennia dan Rhizophora apiculata. The other results are mangrove's leaves and fruit which are processed to be mangrove chips, tea, and syrup. Mangrove management into ecotourism by building mangrove tracks, making trash traps so the garbage from the sea does not enter the stream, vice versa when the high is tide. Sustainable coastal development namely thickening mangrove density by planting mangrove from nurseries and creating hardware on the beach in the form of a tetrapod. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Ecology; Fisheries; Tea; Area development; Coastal area; Coastal communities; Coastal development; Eco-tourisms; Indonesia; Mangrove forest; Beaches","","","","","","","Setyaningrum EW, Dewi A T K, Prapti KP, Erwanto K P, Susanti HD, IOP Conf Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 236, pp. 1-9, (2019); Eddy S, Ridho MR, Iskandar I, Mulyana A, Jurnal Silvikultur Tropika, 7, pp. 42-47, (2016); Walters BB, Ronnback P, Kovacs JM, Crona B, Hussain SA, Badola R, Primavera JH, Barbier E, Dahdouh-Guebas F, Aquatic Botany, 89, pp. 220-236, (2008); Strauch AM, Cohen S, Ellmore GS, J of Wetlands Ecol, 6, pp. 16-24, (2012); Anwar C, Gunawan H, Proceedings of Exposure Research Results, pp. 23-34, (2006); Primack RB, Supriatna J, Indrawan M, Kramadibrata P, Biologi Konservasi, (1998); Samad A, Bambang AN, Afiati N, Internat J Waste Resources, 3, pp. 34-39, (2013); Tampubolon LA, Jurnal Ilmiah Administrasi Publik, 6, pp. 58-70, (2020); Sadan E, Empowerment and Community Planning, (2004); Setyaningrum EW, Proceedings Community Service National Seminar, (2017); Sinohin V, Baconguis S, SEAFDEC Asian Aquaculture, 22, (2000); Situmorang ROP, Barus SP, Proceedings The International Conference of Indonesia Forestry Researchers III, (2015); Macionis J J, Sociology, (2008); Social self-reliance: Manifestation of community capacity to develop independently, pp. 97-113, (2012); Latkova P, Vogt CA, J of Travel Research, 51, pp. 50-67, (2011); Diharto AK, Ismail Y, Iriantini D B, Murtadlo M B, Muafi, Int J.of Civil Eng and Tech, 9, pp. 908-915, (2018); Effendy M, Jurnal Kelautan, 2, pp. 81-86, (2009)","E.W.

However, the forests and their habitat have degraded rapidly due to anthropogenic threats. Consequently, the loss of carbon (C) stored in these ecosystem is inevitable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the species diversity of mangrove forest of Labuhan, Lamongan regency, Indonesia and evaluate its above-ground and below-ground-root biomass and C. Twenty-four plots with a size of 10x10 m were carried out using the quadrat sampling technique to identify, record and measure the DBH of the trees. The Shannon - Wiener's diversity index (H'=1.51) was moderate, having a total of nine true mangrove forests dominated by Rhizophora mucronata and Rhizophora apiculata with an importance value index of 100.40% and 80.46% respectively. The total C stored in above-ground and below-ground-root was 74.70 ± 15.58 Mg C ha-1, which is equivalent to total CO2 sequestration of 274.15 ± 57.18 Mg CO2 ha-1. This study suggests that the Labuhan mangrove forest has a potential to store and sequester a substantial amount of atmospheric C; therefore, it is needed to protect and sustainably manage this important forest. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Biodiversity; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Magnesium; Anthropogenic threats; CO2 sequestration; Diversity index; Ecosystem services; Mangrove forest; Nutrient cycling; Sampling technique; Soil formations; Forestry","","","","","","","Mitra A., Banerjee K., Sett S., Spatial Variation in Organic Carbon Density of Mangrove Soil in Indian Sundarbans, Natl.

Red mangrove propagules were introduced to Moloka'i, Hawai'i, in 1902 to mitigate the effects of soil erosion and have since spread along the coast and to adjacent islands creating novel habitat. We compared zooplankton communities between novel mangrove and historical non-mangrove habitat both within fishponds and along open coastline to examine environmental factors, including mangrove presence, affecting zooplankton community composition. Community composition patterns were driven by lunar cycle and site characteristics, including fishpond structure, mangrove and open-coast shoreline length, percent of mangrove shoreline length, total percent mangrove leaf carbon and upstream watershed disturbance. Our findings indicate that during the tropical summer reproductive season, non-native mangroves support diversity, richness and community composition similar to non-mangrove areas, though some widespread taxa have lower abundance, and some rare taxa are more abundant in mangroves. Additionally, fishpond zooplankton community structure is significantly different from open-coast areas, indicating fishponds, themselves, create novel habitat. Synthesis and application. In the face of declining fisheries, threatened reef habitat and changing climatic conditions, non-native mangroves may provide, rather than impede, zooplankton habitat availability in novel locations. © 2021 British Ecological Society","disturbance; invasive; light trap; management; non-native; plankton tow; red mangrove; Rhizophora mangle","Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Molokai; Rhizophora mangle; Rhizophoraceae; community composition; ecosystem dynamics; endangered species; environmental factor; habitat availability; mangrove; propagule; soil erosion; species diversity; species richness; zooplankton","","","","","Edward D. and Olive C.

The study aims to analyze the area and condition of vegetation from mangrove planting in the Wallacea Region, Bone Bay, South Sulawesi, namely in Sinjai District from 1999 to 2018, and from 2009 to 2018. The mangrove area was obtained from the processing of Landsat 7 satellite images ETM + in 1999 and 2009, as well as Landsat 8 OLI in 2018. The field survey was conducted on December 2018 to check changes in the area of mangrove distribution, and measure tree density and closure of mangrove canopies. There were three classifications of the mangrove distribution in mangrove plantation area, namely: (1) increasing mangrove areas with an additional of 25 to 145 Ha, (2) decreasing mangrove area with reduction 12 to 80 Ha; and (3) constant mangrove areas with an area of 74 to 249 ha. The condition of mangroves in District Sinjai Utara was relatively good and very dense, with a density of 0.29 trees per m2 and a canopy closure of 73.5%. Whereas in District East Sinjai, mangrove conditions are included in the good category with 0.42 trees per m2 and 79.8% canopy closure. Five species were found namely Avicennia alba, Avicennia Officinalis, Nypa fruticans, Rhizophora mucronata, and Rhizophora stylosa mangrove species. Mangrove density ranges between 450 and 7000 trees /Ha. The lowest density was found at Station 11 with the category of rarely, while the highest density was found at Station 9 with the category of very dense. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

There are many biodiversity values of mangrove ecosystems that it can be evaluated economically. This study aims to: (i) identify the species diversity of mangrove forest; (ii) analyze the mangrove productivity and aboveground biomass; (iii) analyze the ecosystem value of mangrove forest in Mentawir Village, Penajam Paser District, East Kalimantan Province. The research used systematic random sampling method by establishing two plots with extent of one hectare for each plot in which each plot was divided into 20m x 20m subplots. The volume and mean annual increment (MAI), as well as current annual increment (CAI), were calculated. Economic value of mangrove ecosystem was calculated using Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) to reveal the total margin between Willingness to Pay (WTP) of wood produced by mangrove forest and Willingness to Accept (WTA) of fisheries catches. The results showed that there were 12 species of mangroves in the studied areas in which Rhizophora apiculata was the dominant species. Total aboveground biomass in Plot I and Plot II were respectively 127.46 tons ha-1 (62.61 tons C ha-1) and 79.26 (38.85 tons C ha-1) and dominated by Rhizophoraceace family with 76.80%, while 23.22% of the biomass was contributed by other mangrove families. The mangrove forest had a maximum average volume increment at 48 years and 42 years with MAI of 2.97 ha-1yr-1and 2.12 m3 ha-1yr-1 at Plot I and Plot II, respectively, with the total volume reached 127.5 m3 ha-1 and 79.60 m3 ha-1. The calculation of total margin between WTP and WTA indicated that in economic value of mangrove ecosystem in Mentawir Village with an extent of 2,300 ha was between IDR 207,000,000 yr-1 and IDR 345,000,000 yr-1. Our findings suggest that a good mangrove ecosystem will result in high economic value and biodiversity values cannot be separated from economic benefits in order to protect its sustainability. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

The aim of this study was to compare the magnitude of predation by these crabs on three mangrove species propagules: Avicennia schaueriana, Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle. We found that G. cruentata is a more important predator than U. cordatus in both natural and restored areas. We also tested the hypothesis that Ucides and Goniopsis have antagonistic effects on propagules predation using a cage experiment where the presence/absence of these species was manipulated in a 2 × 2 factorial design. The effects of Goniopsis were stronger in the absence of Ucides due to negative interactions between these predator species. Moreover, we found that Goniopsis preference for A. schaueriana and L. racemosa can favor the dominance of R. mangle in Neotropical mangroves. This study suggests that propagule predation by Goniopsis should be controlled in mangrove restoration programs at abandoned shrimp farms and destroyed areas, if dominance by R. mangle is undesirable relative to mixed species communities. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Exclusion experiment; Higher-order interactions; Mangrove restoration; Multiple predators; Prey preference","Avicennia; Decapoda (Crustacea); Goniopsis; Goniopsis cruentata; Grapsidae; Laguncularia racemosa; Rhizophora mangle; Rhizophoraceae; Ucides; Ucides cordatus; crab; dominance; exclusion experiment; habitat restoration; hydrobiology; hypothesis testing; mangrove; Neotropical Region; predation; prey preference; pristine environment; propagule; restoration ecology; shrimp fishery","","","","","REUNI; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES","Acknowledgments Conselho de Aperfeic¸oamento de Pessoal Superior (CAPES)/REUNI provided a PhD grant to Alexander C.

The reasons behind these unfortunate events are the unabated illegal activities in the mangroves albeit the enforcement of laws and policies pertaining to its conservation and rehabilitation. For several decades, the Philippine government had been implementing programs and projects aiming to bring back the once pristine and productive mangrove areas through reforestation of denuded areas in the country. However, assessment is needed to evaluate whether these efforts have positively impacted coastal areas. This paper presents the current vegetational condition of selected reforested mangrove areas in Calabanga, San Miguel Bay, Philippines. Fifty-six (56) quadrats measuring 10x10m were established strategically in four (4) randomly selected rehabilitated mangrove sites. The overall results show that ten (10) mangrove species were recorded and Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata got the highest importance values of 111.59 and 105.96 respectively. This only shows that mono-specific mangrove species were considered during the rehabilitation of the areas set aside the environmental parameters affecting survival rate and the ecological diversity of the mangrove forest. A framework was developed to guide the local government in developing their sustainable mangrove management plan. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.","","Reforestation; Ecological diversity; Environmental parameter; Illegal activities; Local government; Management plans; Mangrove forest; Mangrove species; Survival rate; Fisheries","","","","","","","Walters B.B., People and mangroves in the philippines: Fifty years of coastal environmental change, Environmental Conservation, 30, 2, pp. 293-303, (2003); Christensen B., Management and utilization of mangroves in Asia and the pacific, FAO Environment Paper 3.

The export value of charcoal, logs. woodchips and other mangrove products was US$4.1 million in 1978. Until 1970 the allocation of mangrove resources was handled by provincial authorities. Since 1970 concessions for areas greater than 100 ha have been controlled by the central government. The sites under central government concession cover an area of 455 000 ha. This area is divided between 13 major concessions permitting a total maximum annual allowable cut of 599 200m3. In areas under concession, regulation requires that a system of selective cutting combined with seed-tree-based natural regeneration should be applied. A clear-cutting system has been recommended to increase log production. Preliminary studies in different regions show considerable differences in the regeneration process. In Kalimantan it has been shown that. following clear-cutting in alternative strips, regeneration consisted primarily of Rhizophora whilst that of Bruguiera was minimal. Preliminary observations in Sulawesi have shown that no mangrove of commercial value has regenerated. Instead a succession of undergrowth comprising Acanthus ilicifolius and Acrostichum aureum has appeared. The Directorate General of Fisheries of the Indonesian government has recently recommended the establishment of a 400 m-wide 'green belt' of mangrove along all shores where mangrove should normally be found and where conditions are still favourable for mangrove growth. The Directorate General of Forestry is also seeking to re-establish former mangrove areas for production forest. Conflicts have arisen in the implementation of these policies, particularly in locations occupied by brackish water fishponds. A compromise in the form of mangrove cum fish culture was introduced. However, the success of this type of culture is questionable. © 1982.","","","","","","","","","Akhmad, The problem of mangrove forests in densely populated areas, Paper presented at the seminar on mangrove ecosystems.

The crab population of the Caeté peninsula (the location of our study site) has been exploited for the last 40 years. Recovery of fished areas by crabs from non-fished areas under the roots of the mangrove tree Rhizophora mangle was hypothesized to be an important buffer mechanism against rapid overfishing. However, catch per unit effort decreased in recent years, suggesting that the sustainability of the crab fishery might become endangered. It is therefore important to better understand the movement behaviour of these crabs, even though it is hard to observe directly. Following the approach of pattern-oriented modelling, we developed an individual-based model to infer movement behaviour from patterns in density recovery that were observed in field experiments. Two alternative submodels simulating factors causing movement were contrasted: with and without local competition among crabs. To describe local competition, the field-of-neighbourhood (FON) approach was used, which was originally designed for sessile organisms. Without competition, unrealistically high movement frequencies were required to fit the observed linear recovery patterns. With competition included, better fits to the recovery patterns were obtained, and lower and thus more realistic movement frequencies were sufficient. This indicates that local competition between crabs is the main reason for them to move and change their burrows. Our work shows that the FON approach is suitable to describe local interactions not only among sessile organisms, but also among mobile organisms in conditions of competition for resources. The simulation results illustrate the importance of the non-fished rooted areas as buffers against rapid over-fishing. The IBU model presents a potential for future analysis of these buffer mechanisms and thus for a better understanding of the crab fishery and its management. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Eighty-two species belonging to 30 families were identified. More than half of them belonged to the estuarine transient fish group and only 14 species were estuarine resident, highlighting the importance of the Zancudo mangrove as a transition area. The most diverse families were Sciaenidae, Carangidae and Haemulidae for both rainy and dry seasons. As much as 71% of the species captured were of first or second grade economic value and only 11% had no commercial value. Comparing our data with fisheries and scientific surveys inside and outside the gulf suggests the importance of the Zancudo mangrove for regional fisheries and fish diversity. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) indicated gradual changes in the fish community composition from the river mouth to the more internal sampling sites for rainy and dry seasons. Moreover, shifts in abundance and species composition between seasons were observed, mainly an increase in the differences between the boundaries and the central zones of the mangrove. These changes were attributed to the higher salinity differences between sites during the dry season forcing the occasional visitor fish downstream and freshwater fish taxa upstream. While the results contribute to initiatives for participative fisheries management in the region, further studies are needed to analyse the variations in detail. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Eastern Pacific; Fish diversity; Mangrove; Participative sampling; Tropical fjord-like","Costa Rica; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (East); Carangidae; Haemulidae; Rhizophora mangle; Sciaenidae; abundance; community structure; economic analysis; estuarine environment; fish; fishery management; mangrove; salinity; sampling; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; species diversity; taxonomy","","","","","Walton Family Foundation","Acknowledgements We are grateful to all the fishers of Zancudo and especially Juan C.

It is also important for fishery resources and nutrient inputs in marine and brackish water ecosystems. However, little is known about the tropical wetland lagoon ecosystems, particularly mangrove diversity and assemblages. Therefore, this present study was initiated to observe the mangrove species diversity and assemblages together with the conservation status in an important tropical wetland ecosystem in Setiu, Terengganu, Malaysia. In a variety of landward and small fringe island areas, three zones of square plots were selected (zones 1, 2 and 3) to address the objectives of this study. As a result, a total of 20 true mangrove species belonging to 11 genera from nine families were documented, of which, Avicennia rumphiana was listed as vulnerable (VU) by the IUCN. Twelve species of mangrove associates from 11 genera and nine families were also found in the investigated zones at Setiu. One of the mangrove associates, Intsia bijuga, was designated as vulnerable (VU) by the IUCN. The Shannon diversity index (H') of mangroves was found to be 1.08 at Setiu Wetland. Rhizophora mucronata was found to be well-expanded (H' = 1.05) followed by A. rumphiana, A. officinalis, Heritiera littoralis, A. corniculatum. Excoecaria agallocha, Lumnitzera racemosa, and A. ebracteatus (H' = 0.0) as the lowest. The findings of the present study revealed that mangroves in the Setiu Wetland are diverse and healthy compared to other mangrove ecosystems in the region.

Tree density was 3,203 trees ha-1 and basal area was 14.0 m2 ha-1. Litterfall was 1,417 g m-2 yr-1, characteristic of a productive riverine forest. The degradation constant for Laguncularia racemosa leaves varied from 1.71 to 4.7 yr-1 and mean annual net aquatic productivity was 0.41 g C m-3 d-1. There were high concentrations of humic substances (up to 150 mg l-1) early in the wet season. Seasonal variations of the above parameters seemed closely related to the ecology of fish populations. There were 75 fish species distributed in two principal assemblages associated with wet and dry seasons. Diversity and biomass analysis indicated 18 dominant species. Total biomass of the community in this coastal system was estimated at 10 g wet wt m-2. The highest biomass occurred in the wet season. The most common fish species were Mugil curema, Achirus mazatlanus, Galeichthys caerulescens, Arius liropus, Diapterus peruvianus, Lile stolifera, Centropomus robalito, and Eucinostomus sp., all of which have fishery importance. Primary productivity and fish community ecology are controlled by habitat characteristics, river discharge, and climatic seasonality. © 1990 Estuarine Research Federation.","","Mexico, Teacapan-Agua Brava; fish community; lagoon; mangrove; primary productivity","","","","","","","Alvarez-Rubio M., Amezcua-Linares F., Yanez-Arancibia A., Ecología y estructura de la comunidad de peces en el sistema Lagunar Teacapán-Agua Brava.

To mitigate sediment transport, Rhizophora mangle was introduced in estuaries across Hawai'i (c. 1902) further altering fishpond ecosystems. Here, we examine the impact of cultural restoration between 2012-2018 at He'eia Fishpond, a 600-800-year-old walled fishpond. Fishpond water quality was assessed by calculating water exchange rates, residence times, salinity distribution, and abundance of microbial indicators prior to and after restoration. We hypothesized that R. mangle removal and concomitant reconstruction of sluice gates would increase mixing and decrease bacterial indicator abundance in the fishpond. We find that He'eia Fishpond's physical environment is primarily tidally driven; wind forcing and river water volume flux are secondary drivers. Post-restoration, two sluice gates in the northeastern region account for > 80% of relative water volume flux in the fishpond. Increase in water volume flux exchange rates during spring and neap tide and shorter minimum water residence time corresponded with the reconstruction of a partially obstructed 56 m gap together with the installation of an additional sluice gate in the fishpond wall. Lower mean salinities post-restoration suggests that increased freshwater water volume influx due to R. mangle removal. Spatial distribution of microbial bio-indicator species was inversely correlated with salinity. Average abundance of Enterococcus and Bacteroidales did not significantly change after restoration efforts, however, average abundance of a biomarker specific to birds nesting in the mangroves decreased significantly after restoration. This study demonstrates the positive impact of biocultural restoration regimes on water volume flux into and out of the fishpond, as well as water quality parameters, encouraging the prospect of revitalizing this and other culturally and economically significant sites for sustainable aquaculture in the future. © 2018 by the authors.","Aquaculture; Community restoration; Conservation ecology; Mariculture; Microbes; Microbial source tracking; Native Hawaiian fishpond","Hawaii [United States]; United States; Anthozoa; Aves; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidales; Colocasia esculenta; Enterococcus; Rhizophora mangle; Rhizophoraceae; agricultural ecosystem; aquaculture system; bacterium; bioindicator; coastal zone; community resource management; coral reef; deposition; discharge; environmental restoration; estuarine sediment; mangrove; mariculture; mixing; nearshore environment; pond culture; sediment transport; tracking; water budget; water quality","","","","","Na Kilo Honua o He‘eia; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA; Water Resources Research Institute, North Carolina State University, NC WRRI, (2016HI461B); University of Hawai'i, UH, (NA140AR4170071)","Funding text 1: This project would not have been possible without the support and collaboration of Paepae o He'eia, their incredible stewardship of He'eia Fishpond and their support of our work in this wonderfully unique and beautiful coastal system.

Location: Global. Time period: 1997–2015. Major taxa studied: Avicennia, Laguncularia, Rhizophora, Aves, Actinopterygii, Crustacea and Mollusca. Methods: This review extracts results of mangrove studies on forest cover and structure, nutrient dynamics, sediment contamination and faunal community assemblages conducted around the world between 1997 and 2015. These observations are then correlated with surrounding social–ecological spatial characteristics pertaining to urbanization. Results: Mangrove coverage in large cities is mostly decreasing, and at a greater rate than means for corresponding countries. Both expanding urbanization and existing agriculture are most strongly correlated with mangrove losses, which are primarily occurring 5–10 km from urban areas. Along a gradient of surrounding urban land use, mangrove leaf δ15N content increases, and leaf carbon to nitrogen ratios decrease. Sediment concentrations of almost all examined heavy metals are strongly and positively correlated with both surrounding urban and mangrove extent. The diversity of subsistence fisheries increases significantly with surrounding mangrove extent. Worm diversity decreases with increasing surrounding urbanness (urban index), and mangrove specialist bird diversity increases with increasing surrounding urban coverage as well as with mangrove coverage. Main conclusions: Mangroves increasingly coexist within highly anthropogenic landscapes along urbanized coasts. Most ecological reports of these systems, however, lack quantified representations of the urban landscape, such as population density or impervious surface coverage. The results of this analysis suggest that some of the reported patterns of forest coverage, nitrogen dynamics, heavy metal contamination and faunal community assemblages in isolated urban mangroves are systemic across the world. These findings are particularly pertinent to 21st century tropical coastlines, which will see some of the greatest urbanization rates over the next century and will guide urban mangrove ecology towards the development of more synergistic social–ecological systems. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","anthropogenic;

Healthy and mature propagules and seeds of selected mangroves, Rhizophora apiculata, R. stylosa, Ceriops tagal, Avicennia marina, A. alba, and Acanthus ilicifolius were collected from North Sumatran mangroves. Mangrove seedlings were grown for three months in 0.0%, 0.5%, 1.5%, 2.0% and 3.0% salinity concentration. The growth of mangrove seedlings emerged to show variation among the species. The growth of two salt secretor species of A. marina and A. alba were increased in the occurrence of salt with maximum activation at 2.0%. This escalation was reduced once salt concentration was increased above 2.0%. By contrast, two non-salt secretor species of R. apiculata and R. stylosa significantly expanded to 1.5% salinity, at that moment decreasing by accumulative salts. A salt secretor species of Ac showed the less salt tolerant of mangrove species. ilicifolius and a nonsalt-secretor of C. tagal, which their optimum growth was at 0.5% salinity. The tolerance of mangrove species to salt concentration tracked the sequence of Av. marina and Av. alba (most foreshore species) >R. stylosa and R. apiculata>C. tagal>Ac. ilicifolius (most landward species), which is following the natural species distribution and habitat zones. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Fisheries; Marinas; Habitat zonations; Mangrove species; Propagules; Salt concentration; Salt tolerant; Species distributions; Ecosystems","","","","","","","Scholander P.F., Hammel H.T., Hemmingsen E., Garey W., Plant Physiol., 37, 6, pp. 722-729, (1962); Giri C., Ochieng E., Tieszen L.L., Zhu Z., Singh A., Loveland T., Masek J., Duke N., Global Ecol.

The purpose of this study was to determine carbon uptake in the mangrove vegetation of Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata in Banda Aceh. The research was carried out in two sampling sites, those were Gampong Jawa and Lambaro Skep Banda Aceh on January to March, 2018. This research was conducted at Marine Chemistry and marine Biology Laboratory, Faculty of Marine and Fisheries, Syiah Kuala University. The method used in this study was destructive sampling method. The results of the study showed that the amount of carbon absorption by Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata were 4033.33 g CO2/tree and 3888.36 g CO2/tree, respectively. The results of statistical calculations using the t-test showed that the carbon absorption of Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata did not different significantly, where the value of p> 0.05 (p = 0.33). Furthermore, the differences between sites also showed that the two stations were not significantly different, with a value of p>0.05 (p = 0.47). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Fisheries; Marine biology; Plants (botany); Banda Aceh; Carbon uptake; Destructive sampling; Mangrove ecosystems; Marine chemistry; Sampling site; Soil organic matters; Statistical calculations; Forestry","","","","","","","Ati R.N.A., Rustam A., Kepel T.L., Sudirman N., Astrid M., Daulat A., Mangindaan P., Salim H.L., Hutahaean A.A., Jurnal Segara, 10, pp. 98-171, (2014); Suryono, Nirwani S., Edi W., Raden A., Edi F.R., Buletin Oseanografi Marina, 7, 1, pp. 1-8, (2018); Rachmawati D., Setyobudiandi I., Hilmi E., Omni-Akuatika Journal, 10, pp. 85-91, (2014); Kauffman J.B., Heider C., Cole T.G., Dwire K.A., Donato D.C., Wetlands, 31, 2, pp. 343-352, (2011); Sahu S.C., Manish K.M., Ravindranath N.H., Curr Sci, 110, 12, pp. 2253-2260, (2016); Donato D.C., Kauffman J.B., Murdiyarso D., Kurnianto S., Stidham M., Kanninen M., Nat Geosci, 4, 5, pp. 293-297, (2011); Khairul M.L., Aras M., Dessy Y., Estimasi Karbon Tegakan Rhizophora Apiculata Dan Karbon Organic Tanah di Ekosistem Mangrove Pulau Cawan, Indragiri Hilir, Riau, (2017); Widyastuti A., Edy Y., Ery K.N., Rochmatino, Biodiversitas, 19, 1, pp. 246-252, (2018); Imiliyana, Muryono A.M., Purnobasuki H., Estimasi Stok Karbon Pada Tegakan Pohon Rhizophora Stylosa di Pantai Camplong, Sampang-madura; Mudiyarso D., Hairiah K., Noordwijk M.V., Modelling and Measuring Soil Organic Matter Dynamics and Greenhouse Gas Emissions after Forest Conversion, (1994); Heriyanto N.M., Subiandono E., Jurnal Penelitian Dan Konservasi Alam, 9, 1, pp. 023-032, (2012); Brown S., Sathaye J., Cannell M., Kauppi P.E., Mitigation of carbon emissions to the atmosphere by forest management, The Commonwealth Forestry Review, pp. 80-91, (1996); Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, (2001); Bengen D.G., Pedoman Teknis Pengenalan Dan Pengelolaan Ekosistem Mangrove.

The times required for loss of half the initial ash-free dry weight of immersed leaves were 13~ 16 days for Avicennia marina, 17 ~ 18 days for Rhizophora stylosa, 24~34 days for Sonneratia alba and 52~65 days for Bruguiera gymnorrhiza. The rates of degradation of mangrove leaves immersed in the lower esturary appeared to be slightly faster than those immersed in the mid estuary. Non-cellulose carbohydrate contents of the decaying leaves were about 3~20% of the corresponding ash-free dry weight which tended to decrease towards the end of the experiment. On the contrary, the levels of the amino acid contents in the decaying leaves were rather complex and apparently increased during some periods of immersion except the case of A. marina. © 1989, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

L-methioninase could be found in plants, bacteria, and fungi. The aims of this study was to obtain L-methioninase-producing endophytic bacteria isolated from mangrove Rhizophora mucronata. The mangrove was collected from Jenu Beach, Tuban, East Java, Indonesia. The samples were roots, stems, and leaves of Rhizophora mucronata. Endophytic bacteria were pure isolated using LB agar medium. Each bacteria were screened its capability to produce L-methioninase using selective media namely modified Czapek Dox agar. The best producer of enzyme was further identified with morphological and biochemical analysis. The result showed that three bacteria produced L-methioninase. Based on the result of morphological and biochemical analysis, the best producer was Bacillus subtilis UBTn7. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Algae; Bacteriology; Enzymes; Fisheries; Polysaccharides; Wetlands; Agar medium; Alpha-keto acids; Bacillus Subtilis; Biochemical analysis; Endophytic bacteria; Indonesia; L-Methioninase; Bacteria","","","","","","","Sato D., Nozaki T., IUBMB Life., 61, 11, pp. 1019-1028, (2009); Nozaki T., Ali V., Tokoro M., Advances in Parasitology, 60, pp. 1-99, (2005); Christina A., Christapher V., Bhore S.J., Pharmacogn Rev., 7, 1, pp. 11-16, (2013); Brader B., Compant S., Mitter B., Trognitz F., Sessitsch A., Curr.

This study assessed the spatial variation of selected physicochemical parameters (pH, nitrates, phosphates, and conductivity) in water and sediments from the Chilaw lagoon and its fringe mangroves located on the North-Western coast of Sri Lanka. Interviews were also conducted with local communities (including fishermen) on the social-ecological impacts of pollution in the lagoon ecosystem. Physicochemical analysis was conducted following the APHA standard methods. Statistically significant differences at 95% confidence interval were observed for levels of physicochemical parameters in water and sediment samples, with a horizontal (i.e. length-wise) and vertical (i.e. depth-wise) pollution stratification in the lagoon. Latitude had significant effects on the levels of physicochemical parameters recorded in surface water samples. High levels of pH (pH > 9) recorded in water samples were evidenced by the observation of algal blooms and limited fish catch in the lagoon over the years. Local people report a novel impact of effluent pollution on mangroves, where redworms feed on mangrove leaves. The study, therefore, calls for immediate control of effluent pollution from shrimp farming and other point sources. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Effluents;

Box 61, Paraná, Brazil","Although Brazil has defined mangroves as permanent preservation areas and banned the exploration of any mangrove resources, wood is still explored by underprivileged coastal populations. Restrictions regulating the use of mangrove wood are at odds with the social reality of many traditional or neo-traditional coastal populations that depend on this resource. The current social conflicts raised or intensified by a restrictive federal legislation clearly point to the need of less controversial management strategies. Knowledge of the present and past usage of mangrove resources is a necessary basis for the development of more viable and reasonable conservation strategies. In this study, we defined the current and past uses of mangrove wood in coastal villages of the subtropical Bay of Paranaguá, in Southern Brazil. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with longtime residents or community leaders. The main past uses were woodcutting for firewood and tannin extraction, sold or used for subsistence. Current uses are mostly related to fishing activities and have been restricted to personal consumption. The use of wood has declined in the last decades due to law restrictions, the increasing availability of new energy sources and new materials for fishing such as nylon nets. We suggest that natural forest turnover, combined with appropriate management actions, could allow for sustainable wood extraction in places where populations are small and mangroves are extensive, as in this subtropical estuarine system. Even though the current need for wood resources is not significant, the use of wood may help local residents in their daily needs and improve their quality of life. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Avicennia; Forest resource; Laguncularia; Mangroves wood; Rhizophora","Brazil; Mangrove; Tannins; Brazil; Parana [Brazil]; Paranagua Bay; Avicennia; Laguncularia; Rhizophora; Rhizophoraceae; Extraction; Fisheries; Tropics; Wood; Wood preservation; Avicennia; Conservation strategies; Federal legislations; Forest resources; Laguncularia; Management strategies; Rhizophora; Semi structured interviews; coastal zone management; conservation management; federal system; forest resource; legislation; mangrove; resource use; social conflict; subtropical region; sustainability; wood; Forestry","","","","","State of Paraná, (424/12, 969628); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Centro de Estudos do Mar, Universidade Federal do Paraná, CEM,UFPR","We thank all the anonymous interviewees and people from the fishing villages for their help and support.

On all sampling occasions replicate samples were taken on two consecutive nights. In all, 3320 fish were collected, representing 42 species and weighing 141 498 g. Significantly fewer fish were caught on the second night than on the first night. Economically important fish of the Families Atherinidae, Mugilidae, Gerreidae, Sparidae and Sillaginidae represented >76% by number and >74% of the total weight caught. The mean density of fish in the forest was 0.04 ± 0.01 m-2, with a biomass of 1.3 ± 0.2 g m-2. This is lower than that found in similar studies on other mangrove communities. The fish community was dominated by detritivores and intermediate carnivores, many of which are of economic value. Although the fish use of this subtropical R. stylosa forest was low, this habitat is important as a feeding and nursery area for fish species that contribute to the fisheries value of the region.","","Australia, Queensland, Tin Can Bay; Rhizophora stylosa; Atherinidae; Gerreidae; Mugilidae; Rhizophora stylosa; Rhizophoraceae; Sillaginidae; Sparidae; biomass; community structure; density; mangrove swamps; subtropical forest","","","","","","","Bell J.D., Pollard D.A., Burchmore J.J., Pease B.C., Middleton M.J., Structure of a fish community in a temperate tidal mangrove creek in Botany Bay, New South Wales, Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 35, pp. 33-46, (1984); Blaber S.J.M., Blaber T.G., Factors affecting the distribution of juvenile estuarine and inshore fish, Journal of Fish Biology, 17, pp. 143-162, (1980); Blaber S.J.M., Milton D.A., Species composition, community structure and zoogeography of fishes of mangrove estuaries in the Solomon Islands, Marine Biology (Berlin), 105, pp. 259-267, (1990); Blaber S.J.M., Young J.W., Dunning M.C., Community structure and zoogeographic affinities of the coastal fishes of the Dampier region of north-western Australia, Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 36, pp. 247-266, (1985); Burchmore J., Management of the estuarine habitat, Proceedings of the Australian Society of Fish Biology Workshop, pp. 184-187, (1993); Hyland S.J., Butler C.T., The Distribution and Modification of Mangroves and Saltmarsh-claypans in Southern Queensland, (1988); Kay G., Fishermen recognise 1989 as 'year of the environment, The Queensland Fisherman, 7, 5, pp. 23-26, (1989); Kjelson M.A., Colby D.R., The evaluation and use of gear efficiencies in the estimation of estuarine fish abundance, Estuarine Processes, 2, pp. 416-424, (1977); Morton R.M., Community structure, density and standing crop of fishes in a subtropical Australian mangrove system, Marine Biology (Berlin), 105, pp. 385-394, (1990); Morton R.M., Pollock B.R., Beumer J.P., The occurrence and diet of fishes in a tidal inlet to a saltmarsh in southern Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australian Journal of Ecology, 12, pp. 217-237, (1987); Pielou E.C., Shannon's formula as a measure of specific diversity: Its use and misuse, The American Naturalist, 100, pp. 463-465, (1969); Poiner I.R., Conacher C.A., Staples D.J., Moriarty D.J.W., Seagrasses - Why are they important?, Moreton Bay in the Balance, pp. 41-53, (1992); Robertson A.I., Blaber S.J.M., Plankton, epibenthos and fish communities, Coastal and Estuarine Studies No 41.

The presence of various phytochemicals in bioactive constituents of the plant was detected using standard chemical procedures. The Kirby-Bauer test was used for the antibacterial assay, and an in vitro assay was conducted for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bacterial concentration (MBC). Brine shrimp lethality assay evaluated the toxicity of R. apiculata. Antibiotic susceptibility test showed high rates of E. coli resistance to neomycin and sensitivity to tetracycline and amoxycilin, while S. agalactiae showed sensitivity to all antibiotics. Inhibition zones of R. apiculata leave extract against the microorganisms recorded in the range of 2-9 mm. Increasing the inhibition zone is dependent on increasing plant extract concentrations. The (MIC) testing range of R. apiculata was 6.25 mg/ml to 12.5 mg/ml against S. agalactiae and E. coli, respectively. The MBC/MIC ratio of S. agalactiae demonstrated to be bactericidal, and the MBC/MIC ratio of E. coli was bacteriostatic. R. apiculata recorded an LC50 value of 81 mg/ml. The findings of this study reveal the valuable metabolites found in mangrove leaves. The most important secondary metabolites are alkaloids, terpenoids and tannins as well as saponins and steroids, but not flavonoids. This study suggests that Rhizophora apiculata has the potential to be a valuable candidate in the discovery of antimicrobial compounds against fish pathogens. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Antibiotics; Escherichia coli; Extraction; Fish; Fisheries; Lipids; Microwave integrated circuits; Organic solvents; Plant extracts; Anti-microbial activity; Antibiotic susceptibility tests; Antimicrobial compounds; Bioactive compounds; Brine shrimp lethalities; Fish pathogenic bacterium; Minimum inhibitory concentration; Secondary metabolites; Metabolites","","","","","","","Geedhu D, Krishnakumari S, Asian J Pharm Clin Res, 8, pp. 334-338, (2015); Laith A A, Mazlan A G, Effendy A W, Ambak M A, Nadirah M, Muhammad T S, Zain S M, Jabar A, Najiah M, J Biosci.

This study was aimed to assess several factors such us Importance Value Index of mangrove, macrozoobenthos abundance and biophysical-chemistry of water quality for the development of mud crab culture with silvofishery pattern in Kayeli Bay, Buru Regency, Maluku Province, Indonesia. This study was conducted through direct observation of mangrove area by applying survey method using transects of 10×10 m and 5×5 m for the mother tree and seedling of mangrove, respectively, and 1×1 m for macrozoobenthos. Measurements of water biophysical-chemistry was performed directly (in situ) and through laboratory analysis. Result of the present study showed that five types of mangrove were found to grow in mangrove area of Kayeli Bay, namely Rhizophora sp., Avicennia sp., Sonneratia sp., Bruguiera sp. and Ceriops sp.

This study took place in Grand-Lahou, Nzida, Braffedon, Ebonou, Adiadon and Groguida localities. The objective was to contribute to a sustainable management of mangroves in these areas. To do this, managers groups and people living along the mangroves were interviewed using a semi-structured survey method in order to know the anthropic pressures and to map the areas suitable for restoration. Mangrove uses were listed, citation frequencies and use values were calculated, and mapping treatments were performed. The results reveal that the search for Rhizophora racemosa wood and fishing remain the most important activities in the mangroves. Correlatively to these pressures, fishermen mentioned a decrease in fishing products. To rehabilitate the mangrove ecosystem and then restore the fishery stock, sites have been identified for reforestation and mangrove reinforcement operations. These are sites near Braffédon and Ahonzon tislands; between Cap Lahou and Noumouzou village; in Lègrèko and Groguida villages. This study will provide a solid data base for the sustainable preservation of mangrove ecosystems. © 2023 International Formulae Group.

This study aimed to identify the mangrove species present, the crustacean and molluscan macrozoobenthos associated with the mangrove ecosystem, and to evaluate the level of stability of the mangrove ecosystem for the development of edu-tourism activities at the study site employing a Macrozoobenthos Ecological Index. Data on mangrove, macrozoobenthos, and other environmental parameters, were collected at five stations with three replicates per station. Mangrove data was collected within 10 m 10 m plots, while macrozoobenthos were collected with a shovel and sieve net. Seven mangrove species were found: Avicennia marina, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Ceriops decandra, Rhizophora apiculata, Rhizophora mucronata, Rhizophora stylosa, and Sonneratia alba. The width of the mangrove belt ranged from 28.23 to 57.00 m meaning that it was well below the national green belt standard (50-200 m). The organisms associated with mangroves included crustaceans (three species) and molluscs (seven species) with an abundance of 0.01 - 0.07 ind/m2. The Diversity Index was in the average category (1.49 - 1.92), while the Evenness Index ranged from unstable to under pressure (0.476 to 0.64). The Dominance Index was in the unstable category (0.185 - 0.264). Based on the Macrozoobenthos Ecology Indicator, the mangrove ecosystem in the fish ponds was categorised as stable to average. The land suitability analysis indicated that the mangrove ecosystem in the study site was in the conditionally appropriate category for the development of mangrove edu-tourism activities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Fish; Fish ponds; Fisheries; Lakes; Ceriops decandra; Ecological indicators; Ecological indices; Environmental parameter; Land suitability; Mangrove ecosystems; Mangrove species; Tourism activities; Ecosystems","","","","","","","Murdiyarso D., Purbopuspito J., Kauffman J.B., Warren M.W., Sasmito S.D., Donato D.C., Manuri S., Krisnawati H., Taberima S., Kurnianto S., The potential of Indonesian mangrove forests for global climate change mitigation, Nat.

Although remote sensing and aerial photographs can supply valuable information on land/use cover changes, they may not regularly be available for some tropical coasts (e.g., Cameroon estuary) where cloud cover is frequent. With respect to mangroves, researchers are now employing local knowledge as an alternative means of understanding forest disturbances. This paper was primarily aimed at assessing the mangrove forest products usage, along with the local people's perceptions on environmental changes, between Littoral (Cameroon estuary) and Southern (mouth of the Nyong River and Mpalla village) regions of Cameroon.Methods: The data from both locations were obtained through conducting household interviews and field observations.Results: In the Cameroon estuary (Littoral region), 69.23% of respondents (mostly elders) could distinguish two to four mangrove plants, whereas the informants (65.45%) in the mouth of the Nyong River and Mpalla village (mostly young people interviewed from the Southern region) are familiar with only one or two commonly found mangroves. Also, more respondents from the Cameroon estuary are depending on mangroves for fuelwood (Rhizophora spp.) and housing (Rhizophora spp., Avicennia germinans (L.) Stearn and Nypa fruticans (Thumb.) Wurmb.) purposes, in contrast to Nyong River mouth and Mpalla village. Although local people perceived wood extraction as a greater disruptive factor, there are several causes for mangrove depletion in the Cameroon estuary. Among others, over-harvesting, clear-felled corridors, sand extraction and housing were found important. Furthermore, a decline in mangrove fauna composition (in terms of fishery products) was recorded in the Littoral as well as Southern regions. However, the causes of such perceived negative changes were not similar in both cases.Conclusions: Findings of this study highlight the need to improve sustainable management of the mangrove ecosystems through afforestation (in large impacted areas), selective removal of senescent tree stems and branches (in little damage stands), regulating sand extraction and housing activities, and creating awareness and law enforcement. © 2011 Nfotabong-Atheull et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Adult; Aged; Arecaceae; Avicennia; Cameroon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Ethnobotany; Extraction and Processing Industry; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Perception; Rhizophoraceae; Seafood; Trees; Wood; Young Adult; Avicennia; Avicennia germinans; Nypa fruticans; Rhizophora; Rhizophoraceae; adult; aged; Arecaceae; article; Avicennia; Cameroon; ecosystem; environmental protection; ethnobotany; female; human; male; middle aged; mining; perception; Rhizophoraceae; sea food; tree; wood","","","","","Cameroon Oil Transportation Company; National Hydrocarbon Corporation","We gratefully acknowledge the National Hydrocarbon Corporation (NHC) of Cameroon and Cameroon Oil Transportation Company (COTCO) for funding.

The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship (association) between economically important fish species and mangroves with varied characteristics in Maumere Bay, Indonesia. The research used spatial and non-spatial methods; the research on economically important fish species used an experimental fishing sampling method. Correspondence analysis was applied to answer the question why certain economically important fish species were associated with certain mangrove characteristics. The mangroves at the study locations with characteristically dominant species Bruguiera parviflora, Avicennia alba, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Ceriops tagal, with a moderate value of the Shannon diversity index (1< H' ≤3), and moderate value of the Simpson dominance index (0.5< C ≤0.75), associated with the economically important fish species Psammoperca waigiensis, Synanceia verrucosa and Pomadasys maculatus. The locations of mangrove with high mangrove cover (≥ 80%), Avicennia marina as dominant species, large area (100 ha) and high density (≥ 3000 trees / ha), Rhizophora mucronata as dominant species, and high value of Pielou's evenness index (0.6< e ≤1.0) were associated with the economically important fish species Upeneus mollucensis, Lethrinus lentjan, and Lutjanus bitaeniatus. The mangrove locations with medium cover (50% - 75%), moderate values of Simpson dominance index (0.5< C ≤0.75) but high mangrove belt width (≥ 400 m) were associated with the economically important fish species Siganus javus, Stegostoma fasciatum, Mugil cephalus, Carangoides malabaricus and Chanos chanos. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Fish; Fisheries; Importance sampling; Location; Plants (botany); Bruguiera Gymnorrhiza; Correspondence analysis; Dominant species; Fish species; Indonesia; Moderate value; Sampling method; Shannon diversity; Economic analysis","","","","","Nusa Nipa Foundation of Maumere; The Research and Development Centre for Coastal Geospatial Planning; Universitas Hasanuddin","We would like to express our appreciation and gratitude to Nurjannah Nurdin from The Research and Development Centre for Coastal Geospatial Planning, Hasanuddin University for providing facilities in the spatial analysis laboratory, and to Sabinus Nabu from Nusa Nipa Foundation of Maumere for funding this research.

Mangrove ecosystems provide natural habitat for a wide variety of flora and fauna, whilst the economic contribution by mangroves for tourism, fisheries and other natural resources is also of paramount importance. This study focusses on the biodiversity of four major regions of Indian mangroves, namely, Bhitarkanika (Odisha), Pichavaram (Tamil Nadu), Chorao Islands (Goa) and Porlob Jig (Andaman and Nicobar Islands). The study aims to monitor the present status of mangroves in Southern and Eastern coasts of India, with the synergistic use of optical and SAR data. The aerial extents of all the Dominant vegetation spatial maps generated revealed that the Bhitarkanika mangroves had the largest extent (14425 ha) among the four mangrove regions. The second largest area recorded was by the Porlob Jig mangroves of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (9972 ha), followed by the Pichavaram mangroves (788 ha) and the mangroves of Chorao Islands of Goa (603 ha). Decision makers, for taking the necessary conservation and management actions to protect these fragile, vital habitats can ultimately use this data.Key policy insights This paper provides an insight into the major mangrove species of India. It gives a detailed account of the varying mangrove biodiversity in the Eastern and Western coast of India. The prevalence of various kinds of mangroves from different ecosystems were documented. Among these, Rhizophora annamalayana specious was found indigenously in Tamil Nadu. © 2021 Biodiversity Conservancy International.","biodiversity; Indian mangroves; LISS-IV; phytosociological assessment; Resourcesat-2 LISS-III; SAR data; spectral indices","","","","","","Central Island Agricultural Research Institute; Port Blair; Shri Tapan Misra; Indian Council of Agricultural Research, ICAR","The authors are extremely grateful to Shri Tapan Misra, Director, Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad, for his keen interest and for providing the facilities during the execution of the project.

They enrich coastal waters with nutrient, protect coastlines from abrasion and sea level rise as well as support coastal fisheries. Another function of mangroves that are less known is their role in carbon (C) sequestration and storage. Previous studies reveal that mangrove forests contain some of the highest carbon stocks per unit area compared to other forest types. However, that information is not widely available, particularly in Indonesia. This study aimed to determine distribution and community structure of mangroves ecosystem and to estimate carbon stock stored in the mangrove forest of Paliat Island Sumenep East Java. The data collection was conducted on the island, starting from July to September 2017 using harvesting sampling method. Furthermore, to discriminate carbon stock from different parts of mangrove vegetation, One Way ANOVA statistical analysis was employed. The results showed that there were 4 dominant mangrove species on the island namely Rhizophora mucronata, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Rhizophora stylosa and Rhizophora apiculata. The total mangrove biomass of the study area was approximately 21.59 ton/Ha with an estimated carbon stock around 10.80 ton/Ha. Further analysis explained that there was a significant difference in carbon stock between various parts of mangrove vegetation (One Way ANOVA, F = 220, df1=4, df2=85, p<0.05). © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

This research aimed at studying the community structure of mangrove forest in Mojo village, to identifying and analyzing the composition and diversity of gastropod, and investigating the effect of mangrove community on the abundance and gastropod. The research was conducted in Mojo Village, Ulujami District, Pemalang Region from November to December 2017. Identification of species and density was conducted on mangrove species by means of line and plot transects, while the gastropod was sampled from the field then identified in the laboratory. Three sampling stations were occupied in the data collection. The data analysis was conducted for diversity indices, including heterogeneity and evenness both for mangrove and gastropod. Statistical data analysis was conducted by regression to analyze the effect of mangrove density on the abundance of gastropod. The result showed that only three mangrove species were found in Mojo village, including Rhizophora mucronata, Avicennia marina and A. officinalis. Eight gastropod species were identified from mangrove forest of Mojo village. The most dominant gastropod species was Telescopium telescopium, followed by Cerithidea cingulata. The analysis of heterogeneity index showed a low value for mangrove community and medium value for the gastropod community, ranging from 0.353 to 0.720 and 1.462 to 1.812, respectively. Statistical data analysis showed that the density of R. mucronata and A. marina had a significant effect on the abundance of gastropod specieses, including Cerithidea quadrata and Casidula nucleus, both of which had logarithmic relationship trends. © 2019 Polish Society of Ecological Engineering (PTIE).","Density; Diversity; Gastropod; Logarithmic; Mangrove","","","","","","","","Astor T., Lenoir L., Berg M.P., Measuring Feeding Traits of A Range of Litter-Consuming Terrestrial Snails: Leaf Litter Consumption, Faeces Production and Scaling with Body Size, Oecologia, 178, 3, pp. 833-845, (2015); Carpenter K.E., Niem V.H., FAO Species Identification Guide for Fishery Purposes, The Living Marina Resources of the Western Central Pacific, 1, (1998); Cudiamat M.A., Rodriguez R.A., Abundance, Structure, and Diversity of Mangroves in a Community-Managed Forest in Calatagan, Batangas, Verde Island Passage, Philippines, Asia Pacific Journal of Multidisciplinary Research, 5, 3, pp. 27-33, (2017); Fatmawati R.A., Suryanto A., Hendrarto B., Luasan dan Distribusi Mangrove di Kecamatan Ulujami Kabupaten Pemalang dengan Penggunaan Google Earth dan Software ArcGIS (Studi Kasus: Desa Pesantren, Desa Mojo dan Desa Limbangan), Maquares, 5, 4, pp. 427-432, (2016); Flores-Garza R., Garcia-Ibanez S., Flores-Rodriguez P., Torreblanca-Ramirez C., Galeana-Rebolledo L., Valdes-Gonzalez A., Suastegui-Zarate A., Violante-Gonzalez J., Commercially Important Marine Mollusks for Human Consumption in Acapulco, Mexico, Natural Resources, 3, 1, pp. 11-17, (2012); Irma D., Sofyatuddin K., Diversity of Gastropods and Bivalves in Mangrove Ecosystem Rehabilitation Areas in Aceh Besar and Banda Aceh Districts, Indonesia, Aquaculture, Aquarium, Conservation & Legislation International Journal of the Bioflux Society, 5, 2, pp. 55-59, (2011); Ismoyo U., Hendrarto B., Suryanti S., Analisis Bahan Organik dengan Kualitas Tanah terhadap Ukuran Daun Bakau (Rhizophora mucronata Lamk) di Hutan Mangrove Desa Mojo, Ulujami, Pemalang, Journal of Fisheries Science and Technology, 12, 2, pp. 134-138, (2017); Jen H.C., Anh-Tuyet Nguyen T., Wu Y.J., Hoang T., Arakawa O., Lin W.F., Hwang D.F., Tetrodotoxin and Paralytic Shellfish Poisons in Gastropod Species from Vietnam Analyzed by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography and Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Journal of Food and Drug Analysis, 22, 2, pp. 1-11, (2014); Khade S.N., Mane U.H., Diversity of Bivalve and Gastropod Molluscs in Mangrove Ecosystem from Selected Sites of Raigad District, Maharashtra, West coast of India, Recent Research in Science and Technology, 4, 10, pp. 16-20, (2012); Kirchenbaur T., Fartmann T., Bassler C., Loffler F., Muller J., Stratz C., Seibold S., Small-Scale Positive Response of Terrestrial Gastropods to Dead-Wood Addition is Mediated by Canopy Openness, Forest Ecology and Management, 396, pp. 85-90, (2017); Kotte-mapoko E.F., Ngo-massou V.M., Essome-Koum L.G., Emane J.M., Moussian L.N., Tchoffo R., Din N., Molluscs' Composition and Distribution in Mangroves of the Cameroon Central Coast, International Journal of Research Studies in Biosciences, 5, 5, pp. 4-13, (2017); Manullang T., Bakti D., Leidonald R., Structure of Gastropod Communities at Mangrove Ecosystem in Lubuk Kertang Village, West Berandan District, Langkat Regency, North Sumatera Province, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Sciences, 122, 1, (2018); Merly S.L., Elviana S., Korelai Sebaran Gastropoda dan Bahan Organik Dasar pada Ekosistem Mangrove di Perairan Pantai Payum, Merauke, Agricola, 7, 1, pp. 56-67, (2017); Mulya M.B., Arlen H.J., Production of Litter and Detritus Related to the Density of Mangrove, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 130, 1, (2018); Picardal R.M., Dolorosa R.G., The Mollus can Fauna (Gastropods and Bivalves) and Notes on Environmental Conditions of Two Adjoining Protected Bays in Puerto Princesa City, Palawan, Philippines, Journal of Entomology and Zoology Studies, 2, 5, pp. 72-90, (2014); Premcharoen S., Witirawat S., Tharapoom P., Molluscan Fauna in Bang Taboon Mangrove Estuary, Inner Gulf of Thailand: Implications for Conservation and Sustainable Use of Coastal Resources, MATEC Web of Conferences, 60, (2016); Pribadi R., Hartati R., Suryono C.A., Distribution and composition of Gastropoda in mangrove forests of Segara Anakan Lagoon, Cilacap, Ilmu Kelautan, 14, pp. 102-111, (2009); Purnamawati A.D., Saputra S.W., Wijayanto D., Nilai Ekonomi Hutan Mangrove di Desa Mojo Kecamatan Ulujami Kabupaten Pemalang, MAQUARES, 4, 3, pp. 204-213, (2015); Raharja G.R., Sanjoto T.B., Tjahjono H., Keterlibatan Masyarakat dalam Pengelolaan Ekosistem Mangrove di Desa Mojo Kecamatan Ulujami Kabupaten Pemalang, Geo Image, 2, 2, pp. 56-62, (2013); Ramanibai R., Govindan S., Mollusc Diversity at Pulicat Lagoon (India), Transylc.

Tambolongan at Bontosikuyu district was the largest area of about 132 hectares. These values extracted using Landsat imageries based on visual and composite image classification. Since Sentinel 2A launched in 2015, the use of this satellite imagery has spread widely in ecosystem monitoring due to its higher spatial, spectral and temporal resolution and mostly because it is free to access. Nevertheless, field sampling is still needed to crosscheck the final result. Since 2015 three mangrove locations at Selayar island monitored annually. By 2018, two new locations at Pasi island added. In 2019 three sites added at two different islands, so now a total nine mangrove station covering the whole Selayar islands. Nine species of mangroves were found by the end of 2019 monitoring, which are Avicennia alba, A. officinalis, A. marina, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata, R. stylosa, Cerios tagal, and Sonneratia alba. Spectral image characterization by using 12 bands of Sentinel 2A shows that most of these mangroves had peak reflectances at 783 and 865 nanometer, and the highest reflectance are lower than 0.45. These findings may contribute to better spatial identifications for mangrove monitoring and also the consequences to the revision of previous information extracted from Landsat imageries.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Fisheries; Plants (botany); Reflection; Satellite imagery; Spectroscopy; Bruguiera Gymnorrhiza; Composite images; Ecosystem monitoring; Field sampling; Landsat imagery; Project preparation; Spectral images; Temporal resolution; Image enhancement","","","","","","","Cardenas N Y, Joyce K E, Maier S W, Monitoring mangrove forests: Are we taking full advantage of technology?, Int.

Mangrove ecosystems in North Sumatra, Indonesia, have been lost through anthropogenic activities. The purpose of this study was to calculate the potential contribution of mangrove litter to fisheries and to design a dynamic model of mangrove management for optimal and sustainable fisheries utilisation using Powersim Software. This study used observations (mangrove characteristics including litter production and environmental parameters) and interviews (benefit values) to consider the link between mangrove area and fishery resources. The collected data were entered into the dynamic model, and scenarios were simulated for up to 75 years. Results showed that the estimated potential fisheries benefits amount to 1,202.282 kg ha-1 year-1 or IDR 22,663,023 (US$ 1,679) ha-1 year-1. An increase in mangrove area of up to 10 ha year-1 is a minimum requirement for sustainable utilisation of fisheries.

Since the natural products of the mangrove forest, such as wood and seafood, are not able to meet the economic needs of the local community, some areas have been converted into brackish water ponds with traditional aquaculture systems. The growth of brackish water ponds over the last five decades has been identified as the main cause of ecosystem destruction. However, the mangrove ecosystem has been restored naturally through tidal action and seeds falling from mangrove trees. Methods: This study focused on the mangrove tree species Rhizophora apiculata, with ages ranging from 3 to 40 years. Initially, the study site (area, 1 ha) was plotted. The study sample size included 30% of the local population, chosen by systematic random sampling. The data collection was undertaken as follows: 1) measurement of the diameter and height of mangrove trees; 2) observation of local fish auctions; and 3) interviewing of fishers and local communities regarding the direct use of the natural products of the mangrove ecosystem. Results: It is suggested that the total income from wood production is IDR 742,425,000 year -1or US $0.933 person -1day -1. Furthermore, the total income from fishing is IDR 1,080,353,280 year -1or US $1.43 person -1day -1. Pre-thinning income level for wood harvesting is still low. The income difference between wood production and fishing resulted in the rate of overfishing reaching 45.5%. The highest observed wood production was reached at the age of 25 years, and the highest value of mean annual increment (MAI) is 5.39 m 3ha -1at the age of 40 years. Conclusions: This study showed that tree thinning, ranging from 90 to 350 trees ha -1, can increase the value of MAI by around 24.5%. © 2019 Lahjie AM et al.","Direct use; Economic valuation; Ecosystem services; Mangrove restoration","Bays; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Indonesia; Rhizophoraceae; Wetlands; adolescent; adult; article; child; female; fishing; forest; height; human; Indonesia; major clinical study; male; mangrove; nonhuman; peer review; plant seed; sample size; bay; ecosystem; environmental protection; fishery; growth, development and aging; Indonesia; Rhizophoraceae; wetland","","","","","","","Barbier E.B., Hacker S.D., Kennedy C., Et al., The value of estuarine and coastal ecosystem services, Ecol Monogr, 81, 2, pp. 169-193, (2011); The world’s mangroves 1980-2005, pp. 1-6, (2007); Blasco F., Aizpuru M., Gers C., Depletion of the mangroves of Continental Asia, Wetl Ecol Manag, 9, 3, pp. 255-266, (2001); Giri C., Ochieng E., Tieszen L.L., Et al., Status and distribution of mangrove forests of the world using earth observation satellite data, Glob Ecol Biogeogr, 20, 1, pp. 154-159, (2011); Mijan-Uddin S.M., Hoque A.T., Abdullah S.A., The changing landscape of mangroves in Bangladesh compared to four other countries in tropical regions, J Forestry Res, 25, 3, pp. 605-611, (2014); Okpiliya F.I., Udida A.A., Oka P., Effect of Timber Resource Processing on the Edibe-Edibe Creek in Calabar South Local Government Area of Cross River State, Nigeria, International Journal of Physical and Human Geography, 1, pp. 10-17, (2013); Saenger P., Hegerl E.J., Davie J.D.S., Global status of mangrove ecosystems, Environmentalist, 3, 3, pp. 1-88, (1983); Valiela I., Bowen J.L., York J.K., Mangrove Forests: One of the World's Threatened Major Tropical Environments: At least 35% of the area of mangrove forests has been lost in the past two decades, losses that exceed those for tropical rain forests and coral reefs, two other well-known threatened environments, Bioscience, 51, 10, pp. 807-815, (2001); Alongi D.M., Present State and Future of the World's Mangrove Forests, Environ Conserv, 29, 3, pp. 331-349, (2002); Duke N.C., Meynecke J.O., Dittmann S., Et al., A world without mangroves?, Science, 317, 5834, pp. 41-42, (2007); Ewel K.C., Twilley R.R., Ong J.E., Different Kinds of Mangrove Forests Provide Different Goods and Services, Global Ecol Biogeogr, 7, 1, pp. 83-94, (1998); Moberg F., Ronnback P., Ecosystem services of the tropical seascape: Interactions, substitutions and restoration, Ocean Coast Manag, 46, 1–2, pp. 27-46, (2003); Lahjie A.M., Isminarti, Simarangkir B.D., Community forest management: Comparison of simulated production and financial returns from agarwood, tengkawang and rubber trees in West Kutai, Indonesia, Biodiversitas, 19, 1, pp. 126-133, (2018); Elster C., Reasons for reforestation success and failure with three mangrove species in Colombia, For Ecol Manage, 131, 1–3, pp. 201-214, (2000); Lewis R.R., Ecological engineering for successful management and restoration of mangrove forests, Ecol Eng, 24, 4, pp. 403-418, (2005); Primavera J.H., Esteban J.M.A., A review of mangrove rehabilitation in the Philippines: successes, failures and future prospects, Wetl Ecol Manag, 16, 5, pp. 345-358, (2008); Samson M.S., Rollon R.N., Growth performance of planted mangroves in the Philippines: revisiting forest management strategies, Ambio, 37, 4, pp. 234-240, (2008); King R.T., Wildlife and man, 20, pp. 8-11, (1966); Helliwell D.R., Valuation of wildlife resources, Regional Stud, 3, 1, pp. 41-47, (1969); Ecosystems And Human Well-being.

Major goods and services from a 12-year plantation were identified as: firewood and building poles, coastal protection, ecotourism, research and education, carbon sequestration and on-site fisheries. The net value of extractable wood products was estimated at US$379.17/ha/yr. For nonextractable products, however, the net value ranged from US$44.42/ha/yr in carbon sequestration to US$1,586.66/ha/yr in coastal protection. The total economic value of a 12-year-old Rhizophora plantation was therefore US$2902.87/ha/yr.

However, over the last two decades harvesting of mangrove forests has been extensive with effects on mangrove biodiversity and ecosystem services. We investigate the effect of mangrove harvesting on tree biodiversity in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using two line transects each in ten mangrove forests, mangrove composition, species dominance, density, frequency, coverage, and stem diameter and diversity were recorded. Interviews detailing provisioning ecosystem services were also conducted with local forestry and fishery workers to determine the level of exploitation. Ten mangrove species were recorded (Avicennia alba, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Ceriops tagal, Excoecaria agallocha, Lumnitzera racemosa, Nypa fruticans, Rhizophora apiculata, Rhizophora mucronata, Rhizophora stylosa, and Sonneratia alba) belonging to six families (Avicenniaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Combretaceae, Arecaceae and Sonneratiaceae). Mangrove forests are now dominated by saplings and seedlings, with few trees above 15 cm diameter at breast height. Rhizophora sp. were found to be the most important and dominant species. Rhizophora sp. was the most widely used as it was deemed the most suitable for firewood and charcoal. In addition, it is the main species planted in mangrove restoration projects, which have focused on establishing production forest rather than restoring natural species composition and structure. Despite the decrease in biodiversity, the mangroves still provide a wide range of ecosystem services to the communities in the area. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Biodiversity; Ecosystem service; Indonesia; Mangrove forests; Sulawesi","Greater Sunda Islands; Indonesia; Sulawesi; Sunda Isles; Acanthaceae; Arecaceae; Avicennia alba; Bruguiera gymnorhiza; Ceriops tagal; Combretaceae; Euphorbiaceae; Excoecaria agallocha; Lumnitzera racemosa; Lythraceae; Nypa fruticans; Rhizophora; Rhizophora apiculata; Rhizophora mucronata; Rhizophora stylosa; Rhizophoraceae; Sonneratia alba; biodiversity; coastal zone; community composition; ecosystem service; harvesting; mangrove; transect","","","","","Department of Geography; Department of Geosciences and Natural Resources Management, University of Copenhagen; Directorate of Higher Education, Ministry of Education and Culture; Government of South Sulawesi and Takalar District; State University of Makassar","We would like to thank the Directorate of Higher Education, Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia, which has financially supported this research in collaboration with the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resources Management, University of Copenhagen.

However, most of the mangrove wetlands structural and functional information useful to evaluate the quality, quantity and monetary value of its ESs has been obtained from studies at tropical latitudes usually dominated by large deltas and extensive coastal lagoon and estuaries. Thus, there is a major data gap for mangrove wetlands located in arid and semi-arid regions due to their limited land cover and location at the boundary of transitional climate gradients. Here we analyze the spatial distribution of mangrove wetlands carbon stocks and net primary productivity (i.e., litterfall and root productivity) in La Paz Bay, an arid coastal region in the Gulf of California, Mexico, where mangrove wetlands are spatially distributed in conspicuously extensive patches. We used this information to qualitatively rank ESs. Three peri-urban mangrove wetland sites (Balandra, Enfermeria, and Zacatecas) were characterized by different degrees of anthropogenic impact. Aboveground biomass (interval: 13.6 to 31.6 Mg C ha−1) was in the lower range when compared globally. The average C storage in mangrove soils (at 45 cm depth) in La Paz Bay is 175 Mg C ha−1, which is higher than the values reported for other arid zones (≥1 m soil depth: 43–156 Mg C ha−1). Belowground root biomass and productivity values (roots range: 0.22–0.31 Mg C ha−1; fine roots NPP: 0.06–0.09 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) were in the lower range. We found distinct differences in aboveground C storage values among sites where mangrove species formed monospecific stands across the landscape within each site. Areas dominated by the species Rhizophora mangle reflected the highest soil C density values (208.9 ± 144.6 Mg C ha−1), followed by Laguncularia racemosa (181.4 ± 118.2 Mg C ha−1) and Avicennia germinans (155.5 ± 72.1 Mg C ha−1). We identified ESs provided by each of the sites, including both cultural (i.e., ecotourism; especially in Balandra), and provisioning (fisheries) services. Our study is a first step in the quantitative assessment of functional and structural properties as ESs of arid mangrove wetlands in La Paz Bay that could be readily translated into robust economic estimates for this arid coastal region. © 2019","Anthropogenic impact; Biomass; Blue carbon; Ecosystem services; Peri-urban mangroves; Structural properties","Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystems; Food Storage; Water Quality; Wetlands; Baja California Sur; La Paz Bay; Mexico [North America]; Zacatecas; Avicennia germinans; Laguncularia racemosa; Rhizophora mangle; Rhizophoraceae; Arid regions; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon capture; Coastal zones; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Food storage; Soils; Spatial distribution; Structural properties; Urban growth; Water quality; Wetlands; Anthropogenic impacts; Arid and semi-arid regions; Ecosystem services; Functional information; Laguncularia racemosa; Net primary productivity; Peri-urban mangroves; Quantitative assessments; anthropogenic effect; arid region; belowground biomass; biological production; carbon sequestration; coastal erosion; coastal lagoon; ecosystem service; environmental gradient; mangrove; periurban area; semiarid region; urban system; wetland; Forestry","","","","","US National Science Foundation-FCE-LTER program; National Science Foundation, NSF, (DEB-1237517); U.S. Department of the Interior, DOI, (#G12AC00002); Department of the Interior Southeast Climate Science Center, SE CSC, (12AC00002); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT, (388919); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONCYT; Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, FONACYT","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the Mexican Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT) agency through a research grant to ESZ and SELlC and a doctoral scholarship to JGOG (grant # 388919).

In several parts of the world, 'no-take' zones, areas where fishing is forbidden, have been shown to benefit exploited populations, critical habitats, and community structure (see studies listed in NRC, 1999). Because fishing and bycatch mortality are all but eliminated in no-take areas, fish within these zones should live longer, grow larger, and be more fecund than those in fished areas (PDT, 1990; Bohnsack, 1993). Despite these expected benefits, the creation of marine protected areas in U.S. waters is relatively new, and where they have been established, they have been small in scale (Ogden, 1997; Murray et al., 1999). Consequently, there are few examples of no-take zones in the U.S. that can be used to evaluate their true benefits for exploited marine species. While the scientific community has largely embraced the use of marine reserves in fisheries management, detractors, mostly sport fishermen, continue to point to the lack of evidence that expected benefits will actually materialize (Law, 1996; Parrish, 1999; Lydecker, 2000; Wickstrom, 2000a,b). Size-distribution data can be a useful tool to assess the effectiveness of no-take reserves. The shape of length-frequency distributions is a result of recruitment, growth, mortality, and sampling (MacDonald, 1987). If sampling bias is comparable, a species' length-frequency distribution from different areas can yield important biological information specific to a given location. Since fishing mortality is selective towards larger fish and will be greater in fished areas than no-take zones, areas free of fishing mortality would be expected to contain more large individuals. Here, we report length-frequency patterns observed from an ongoing study designed to examine fish utilization of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) shorelines in southeastern Florida. In this effort, differences in the size structure of gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus), a species that is considered overexploited in this region (Ault et al., 1998), were revealed between an area closed to fishing and in surrounding waters open to recreational fishing.","","United States; Lutjanus; Lutjanus griseus; Martes; Rhizophora; Rhizophora mangle; fishery management; fishery regulation; length-frequency analysis; mangrove; protected area; size structure","","","","","","","Ault J.S., Bohnsack J.A., Meester G.A., A retrospective (1979-1996) multispecies assessment of coral reef fish stocks in the Florida Keys, Fish.

Although successive monitoring of mangrove growth after planting has been conducted in some afforestation stands, measurements of soil environmental changes accompanying plant growth have not been made in most stands. In this study, we observed the interactive relationship between the underground root biomass of mangrove, Rhizophora stylosa, and soil chemical properties at an afforestation stand on Tarawa atoll, Kiribati. Methods: We first estimated underground root biomass in the stand. Next, we measured the concentrations of dissolved phosphorus, nitrogen, and other ions (Br−, Ca2+, K+, Na+, Cl−, and SO42−) in soil pore water, as well as the isotopic ratio of leaf carbon and nitrogen in mangrove patches of different ages. Results: Estimated underground root biomass was positively related with phosphate and nitrate concentrations in soil pore water, indicating the formation of a rhizosphere environment. Leaf δ15N analysis suggested that the discrimination of nitrogen isotopes during nitrification and/or uptake of NH4+ and NO3− occurs in accordance with plant growth. Differences in salt stress among the patches were reflected in leaf δ13C, suggesting it would be a good indicator of the physiological response of mangrove plants to salinity. Conclusions: Our findings revealed the changes that occur on a yearly basis in the chemical properties of mangrove leaves and soil pore water after mangrove plantation. These data help to improve our understanding of environmental succession during the formation of mangrove ecosystems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Nitrification; Phosphorus mobilization; Rhizophora stylosa; Soil pore water; δ<sup>13</sup>C; δ<sup>15</sup>N","Gilbert Islands; Kiribati; Tarawa; isotopic ratio; mangrove; nitrification; physiological response; porewater","","","","","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund Project, (JPMEERF15S11406, JPMEERF20172012); Ministry of Environment, Lands and Agriculture Development, (012/16); Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, ERCA; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN, (16H04941)","Funding text 1: This work was partly supported by JSPS KAKENHI (grant no. 16H04941) and by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund Project (nos.

Its mangrove is the largest coastal ecosystem which is important for sustainable fisheries and coastal disaster mitigation. The main objective of this study is to understand the condition of mangrove community, its impact on fisheries and threats to its continuity. Stratified random sampling on three plots of 10 m x 10 m and hemispherical photography are employed on 13 observation sites across four zones. Local fishermen are interviewed about their activities related to mangroves. From 13 observation sites, 19 species from 8 families and 10 genera are identified. The average of mangrove density and its canopy coverage were respectively 2,997 stand/ha and 74.66%. These values can be interpreted as in good condition and moderate coverage (KepmenLH 201/2004). Rhizophora mucronate and Sonneratia alba are the two most dominant species in all observation sites. Local fishermen's activities in the mangrove area are catching crabs, trap-fishing, and cutting mangrove woods for firewood and/or simple non-permanent housing. Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Phemphis acidula, Rhizophora mucronate and Ceriops tagal are their favourites.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","Arafura & Timor Seas Ecosystem Action","This study was successfully conducted due to great teamwork and collaboration between BKKPN Kupang and Faculty of Marine Science and Fisheries, Pattimura University staff.

Marine and fisheries resources are largely determined by the contribution of mangrove litter. The aims of this study was to determine the production of Rhizophora mangrove leaf litter in Sungai Bersejarah mangrove ecosystem, and to determine the value of environmental parameters related to litter. The research was conducted in January until March 2021 in Sungai Bersejarah mangrove area Kayu Ara Permai, Siak Regency. Line transect plot were used to calculate the density of Rhizophora. Rhizophora litter production was measured using the trap net method placed at three sampling site. Three litter trap nets measuring 1 m x 1 m are placed at each station. Rhizophora tree density ranges from 316 - 444 ind./ha. The production of Rhizophora mangrove leaf litter in Sungai Bersejarah mangrove ecosystem was 0.82 - 1.39 g/m2/day (3.00 - 5.09 ton/ha/year), average was 4.11 ton/ha/year. Analysis of variance test showed that there was a significant difference in Rhizophora leaf litter production between sampling points with different Rhizophora tree densities (p<0.05). Mangrove vegetation density has a moderate relationship (r=0.43) to the production of Rhizophora mangrove leaf litter. Environmental parameters indicate that the condition of the Sungai Bersejarah mangrove ecosystem is still good and can support the life of mangrove vegetation.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","","","Bengen D G, Technical Guidelines for the Introduction and Management of Mangrove Ecosystems, (2002); Wahyuni I, Biodidaktika, 11, pp. 66-67, (2016); Fachrul M F, Bioecological Sampling Method, (2007); Wantasen A S, Journal Platax Scientific, 1, pp. 204-209, (2013); Seawater quality standards, (2004); Conservation of Biological Resources Ecosystems in Coastal Areas and Tropical Seas, (2007); Kusmana C, Papers in the Post-tsunami Mangrove Forest Workshop (Medan), (2005); Dharmawan I W E, Zamani N P, Maddupa H H, Oseanologi dan Limnologi di Indonesia, 1, pp. 13-18, (2016); Nasir M, Desia S, Dewiyanti I, Munira, BIOLEUSER, 1, pp. 121-133, (2017); Zamroni Y, Rohyani I S, Jurnal Biodiversitas, 9, pp. 284-287, (2008); Sopana A G, Widyaleksono T, Soedarti S, Journal of Agricultural Research an Development, 23, pp. 34-41, (2012); Mahmudi M, Soemarno Marsoedi, Arfiati D, Periodic Biological Research, 6C, pp. 19-24, (2011); Andrianto F, Bintoro A, Yuwono S B, Jurnal Sylva Lestari, 3, pp. 9-20, (2015); Kusmana C, Pradyatmika P, Husin Y A, Shea G, Martindale D, Indonesian Journal of Tropical Agriculture, 9, pp. 39-47, (2000); Aida G R, Wardiatno Y, Fahrudin A, Kamal M M, Jurnal Ilmu Pertanian Indonesia (JIPI), 19, pp. 91-97, (2014); Widhitama S, Purnomo P W, Suryanto A, Journal of Maquares, 5, pp. 311-319, (2016)","E.

In addition, Rhizophora sp. is a plant reported to contain steroidal compounds, saponins, flavonoids, and tannins, and flavonoid content is widely found in mangrove plants, especially in its fruit, roots, leaves, and outer bark. This study, therefore, aims to examine the uses of Rhizopora sp. leaves extract in the treatment of catfish infected by A. hydrophila, conducted using a completely randomized design (RAL) of one factor (dose of treatment with extract), consisting of four levels; T1 (1300 ppm), T2 (1600 ppm), T3 (1900 ppm), and CT (0 ppm) serving as a control. Moreover, the leaves were sliced, air dried in the room for 10 days, milled, and then macerated with 95% ethanol for 24 hours. This dough was filtered and the residue was further macerated 3 more times, and the resulting filtrate was blended and evaporated to the point at which the gel-shaped extract was obtained. Furthermore, the catfish were injected intramuscularly with 0.1 mL / fish suspension of A. hydrophila bacteria, and the treatment was conducted twice (18 and 42 hours post injection) by soaking in a solution of The leaves for 5 minutes. Parameter measurements (total erythrocytes, hemoglobin levels, hematocrit) values, and graduation of fish life were evaluated at day 0, 3 and 14, post administration and the results showed a decreased in the assessed parameters of the infected fish, when compared to normal ones, which was further elevated close to that shown by the normal, on the 14th day. Post-healing treatment survival rate is observed to be influenced by the concentration administered, and the results were as follows; T1 (33.30 %), T2 (84.60 %), T3 (66.60 %) and CT (0 %). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Animals; Environmental engineering; Fish; Fisheries; Forestry; Aquatic animals; Completely randomized designs; Flavonoid content; Hemoglobin levels; Leaf extracts; Parameter measurement; Post injection; Steroidal compounds; Plants (botany)","","","","","Institute of Research and Community Service; University of Riau","The authors express their gratitude to the Institute of Research and Community Service, University of Riau, for funding this research, and also the Dean and staff of the Faculty of fisheries and Marine, for the assistance provided.","Wibowo C., Kusmana C., Suryani A., Hartati Y., Oktadiyani P., Prosiding Hasil-Hasil Penelitian IPB, 2009, pp. 158-166, (2009); Syawal H., Karnila R., Kumpulan Abstrak International Conference on Aquaculture Biotechnology, (2016); Ridlo A., Pramesti R., Supriyantini E., Soenardjo N., Buletin Oceanografi Marina, 6, 2, pp. 110-116, (2017); Soonthornchareonnon N., Wiwat C., Chuakul W., Mahidol University J of Pharmaceutical Science, 39, pp. 9-18, (2012); Sharief N.M.D., Rao U.M.V., Journal of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Research, 10, pp. 252-256, (2014); Rastegar S., Gozari M., Journal of Paramedical Scienses (JPS), 8, pp. 1-6, (2017); Rohyami Y., Jurnal Logika, 5, pp. 1-8, (2008); Haris M., Skripsi Fakultas Farmasi, (2011); Rosnizar R., Maulida S., Eriani K., Suwarno, Jurnal Bioleuser, 1, pp. 104-115, (2017); Saptiani G., Hardi E.H., Pebrianto C.A., Agustina, Ardhani F., Nusantara Bioscience, 8, 2, pp. 252-257, (2016); Citterio, Biavasco, Virulence, 6, 5, pp. 417-418, (2015); Harikrishnan R., Nisha R.M., Balasundaram C., Aquaculture, 221, 1-4, pp. 41-50, (2003); Jian J., Wu Z., Fish Shellfish Immunol, 16, 2, pp. 185-191, (2004); Rey-Lopez J.P., Vicente-Rodriguez G., Biosca M., Moreno L.A., Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases, 18, 3, pp. 242-251, (2008); Lukistyowati I., Kurniasih, Jurnal Veteriner, 13, pp. 43-50, (2012); Majum Dar T., Datta S., Ghosh D., Dutta S., Chakraborty A., Goswami, Smazumder R., Indian Journal of Biochemistry & Biophysics, 44, pp. 401-406, (2007); Nahar S., Rahman M.M., Ahmed G.U., Mar F., International Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Studies, 4, pp. 52-60, (2016); Chifdhiyah A.N., Journal of Aquaculture Management and Technology, 1, pp. 35-47, (2012); Manoppo H., Disertasi Sekolah Pascasarjana, (2011); Stoskopf M.K., Fish Medicine, (1992); Syawal H., Karnila R., Dirta A., Kurniawan R., Jurnal Veteriner, 18, 1, pp. 1-6, (2017); Karlina C.Y., Ibrahim M., Trimulyono G., Journal UNESA Lentera-Bio, 2, pp. 87-93, (2013); Yin G., Ardo L., Thompson K.D., Adams A., Jeney Z., Jeney G., Fish and Shellfish Immunology, 26, 1, pp. 140-146, (2010)","H.

In doing so, mangrove forests have converted what is otherwise often barren coastlines into one of the most productive ecosystems on the planet. Measured regarding human livelihoods, carbon processing, fisheries support, erosion control, or biodiversity; mangrove forests are one of the most productive ecosystems on the planet, yet they mangrove forests are historically one of the most underappreciated and misunderstood land cover types. This chapter examines the botany of mangroves. Section 1.1 describes the biology of mangroves with a focus on those present in Ecuador. Section 1.2 examines the dominant Ecuadorian mangrove that is Rhizophora mangle which is currently undergoing a taxonomic reclassification to Rhizophora samoensis. Section 1.3 delineates the global and Ecuadorian distribution of mangrove species. Section 1.4 examines current and past estimates of mangrove forest area for both global mangrove forests and Ecuadorian mangrove forests. Section 1.5 examines the role of mangrove forests in supporting the wider ecosystem that they inhabit. Section 1.6 focusses upon the role of mangrove forests in supporting wild fish fisheries and Sect 1.7 on the manner in which mangrove forests provided important livelihood options and other goods and services to the people that reside nearby. Section 1.8 elucidates on the role of mangrove forests in mitigating global climate change and recent advances in this critical arena. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blue carbon; Mangrove anomaly; Mangrove economy; Mangrove forest cover; Mangrove forests; Mangroves; Rhizophora mangle; Rhizophora samoensis","","","","","","","","Acosta J.R.S., Chain of supply of the ecuadorian black shell and its risk of extinction, Janus, (2018); Aizpuru M., Achard F., Blasco F., Global assessment of cover change of the mangrove forests using satellite imagery at medium to high resolution, EEC Research Project No. 15017-1999-05 FIED ISP FR, Joint Research Center, Ispra, (2000); Alvarez-Leon R., Garcia-Hansen I., Biodiversity associated with mangroves in Colombia, ISME/GLOMIS, 3, 1, pp. 1-2, (2003); Armitage D., Socio-institutional dynamics and the political ecology of mangrove forest conservation in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, Glob Environ Chang, 12, 3, pp. 203-217, (2002); Arriaga L., Montano M., Vasconez J., Integrated management perspectives of the Bahia de Caráquez Zone and Chone River Estuary, Ecuador, Ocean Coast Manag, 42, 2-4, pp. 229-241, (1999); Bakhuizen van den Brink R., Revisio generis Avicenniae, Bull Jard Bot Buitenz, 3, pp. 199-226, (1921); Batagoda B.M.S., The Economic Valuation of Alternative Uses of Mangrove Forests in Sri Lanka, (2003); Blaber S.J.M., Mangroves and fishes: Issues of diversity, dependence, and dogma, Bull Mar Sci, 80, 3, pp. 457-472, (2007); Blanchard J., Prado G., Natural regeneration of rhizophora mangle in strip clearcuts in Northwest Ecuador, Biotropica, 27, 2, pp. 160-167, (1995); Blanco J.F., Mangroves Species Richness: Feedback.

The study was conducted around the mangrove areas of Balasuna and Tampara villages. Observations and measurements of mangrove vegetation were collected using quadrats of 10×10 m2. In addition, fish data were collected on the fish catches of fishermen who used a sero (a set net). The mangrove data was analyzed using the Importance Value Index (IVI), whereas the fish diversity was analyzed descriptively and length-weight correlation. The results indicated that the Tampara mangrove was dominated by Bruguiera gymnorrhiza with an IV of 172.31, followed by akkapanda (Rhizophora apiculata) and ongke (R. mucronata) with an IVI of 68.15 and 59.54, respectively. The Balasuna mangrove was dominated by R. apiculata, followed by B. gymnorrhiza and R. mucronata, with IVI of 143.67, 93.25, and 45.84, respectively. A total of 74 fish species were found at the two sites, including 63 species of reef fish and 11 species of non-reef fish. Based on the analysis of the length-weight correlation, it was found that the fish captured around the mangrove were not well-fed. From this result, it is presumed that food availability in the study location is reducing due to anthropogenic activities like tourism and transportation. Hence, it is proposed that periodic monitoring should be carried out to enhance the ecological health of the mangroves to ensure the fishery production services of mangroves. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

In the last few years, mangrove ecosystems in Mangunharjo Urban Village have been continuously under pressure due to human activities. The main factors causing mangrove damage, namely: (1) Pollution, (2) Conversion of mangrove ecosystems into ponds and (3) Excessive logging. Mangunharjo Village has brackish water fishery potential by having a pond area of ± 10.45 hectares. The research method used in this research is to use a descriptive research method. The data collection technique used is the study of literature. The results showed that the condition of mangrove ecosystems in Mangunharjo Subdistrict decreased from 1990 to 1995 by 50%, but began to increase again in 2002 to 2015 by 18.42%. Mangrove species found in this study were Rhizophora sp, Avicennia sp, Xylocarpus sp and Bruguiera sp. Mangunharjo mangrove ecosystem has the highest density of mangrove species, namely Avicennia sp. As for the results of the analysis of the extent of mangrove ecosystems on the coast of Mangunharjo with the results of fisheries production, it shows that during the period before abrasion the farmer's income was IDR 1,000,000.00 / day these conditions continue to decline to IDR 100,000.00 to IDR 30,000.00 / day until early in 2000. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.","Coastal management; Mangrove ecosystems; Pond fisheries","Fisheries; Information systems; Information use; Lakes; Rural areas; Development resources; Ecological resources; Economic resources; Human activities; Management strategies; Mangrove ecosystems; Mangrove species; research methods; Ecosystems","","","","","","","Alikodra H.S., Mangrove Forest Management Policy Seen from the Environment, The Proceedings of Seminar Vi of the Mangrove Ecosystem, pp. 33-43, (1998); Bengen D.G., Technical Guidelines for Introduction and Management of Mangrove Ecosystems.

Dynamics of mangrove community in revegetation area of Karangsong, north coast of Indramayu District, West Java, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 18: 659-665. Mangrove along the north coast of Java is heavily degraded due to the conversion of land into fish ponds and human settlement areas. A revegetation program has been initiated by the local community of Karangsong Village, Indramayu District, West Java, Indonesia, supported by PT. Pertamina RU VI Indramayu. Our research aimed to study the population dynamics of the mangrove revegetation in Karangsong. Secondary data was collected from the Fishery and Maritime Services of Indramayu and PT. Pertamina. We carried out on-location field observations and we interviewed key respondents. Data was analyzed to describe trends in the diversity index and population dynamics of the mangrove. It was observed that the revegetation effort in the shoreline of Karangsong had covered ± 69.08 hectares which consisting of six species of mangrove and three tree species of coastal vegetation i.e. Rhizophora mucronata Lam., Rhizophora stylosa Griff., Rhizophora apiculata Blume, Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh., Avicennia alba Blume, Sonneratia caseolaris (L.) Engl, Terminalia catappa L., Casuarina equisetifolia L., and Ziziphus mauritiana Lam. The mangrove population increased dramatically, from estimated 25,000 individuals in 2008 to 690,835 individuals in 2016. Rhizophora mucronata was the most dominant species (68.85%), followed by Rhizophora stylosa (18.33%) and Rhizophora apiculata (9.53%). The Shannon diversity index was fluctuated but tend to be increased from 0.80 to 0.95. © 2017, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

The mangroves are quite old, arising some 60 million years ago. Currently the global mangrove coverage is about 15.2 million hectares in 124 countries, and restricted to the latitudes between 30°N and 30°S. There are three major types of mangroves: river-dominated; tide-dominated; and, interior swamp; influenced by tidal and river waters. The mangroves occur in low-lying, broad coastal plains where the topographic gradients are small and the tidal amplitude large. They find it difficult to colonize the coastal zone with waves of high energy and hence they normally establish themselves in sheltered shorelines. The ecological factors that strongly influence the mangroves are wave action, rainfall, freshwater runoff, erosion/sedimentation rates, aridity, salinity, nutrient inputs, and soil quality. The mangroves are not a single genetic group but representing a large variety of plant families (20) and species (71) adapted to tropical inter-tidal environment. Mangrove taxonomy needs much attention. Several species are poorly identified. There are several natural hybrids, but their parental species are not clearly understood. Another problem in the taxonomy of mangroves is the confusion between the species of ""true mangroves"" and mangrove associates. Often the same species is named differently at different sites. Molecular analyses may eventually help resolve the taxonomic problems. There are mangrove species endemic to certain places. Discontinuous distribution of mangrove species is also of interest. Asia region is rich in mangrove biodiversity with 55 species and it also has the largest extent of mangrove coverage (38.5% of total). Globally two species are critically endangered, three endangered and six are at vulnerable status and these species pose problems of slow growth and low seed viability. Two species, Sonneratia griffithii and Heritiera fomes exhibited high global loss that ranged from 50-80%. Such an assessment of conservation status of the mangrove species in different countries assumes great importance. In India, 67% of mangrove plants, 52% of macroalgae, 10% of invertebrates and 4% of vertebrates associated with mangrove systems are at threat. However, a methodology exclusively for assessing conservation status of mangrove species is yet to be perfected. Mangroves are unique to have genes for betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase and several antioxidative enzymes which play role in stress tolerance of mangrove species. The mangroves display high genetic diversity as a result from genotype differences, or from phenotypic responses to local environments. The molecular markers used to study genetic variability in mangroves are (i) allozymes, (ii) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), (iii) random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), (iv) amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), (v) microsatellites (SSR), (vi) Inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR), and (vii) DNA sequence. Mangroves are able to adapt to themselves to practically all types of adverse conditions except frost, and hence they are distributed mostly in the tropical regions. Probably there are no other groups of woody plants in the entire plant kingdom with such highly developed adaptations. These adaptations vary among mangrove species and with physicochemical nature of their habitats. The mangroves have exposed breathing roots, extensive support roots, salt-excreting leaves, and viviparous water-dispersed propagules. The mangroves have xerophytic and hydrophytic characters in leaves and roots respectively. The aerial parts of the mangroves are equipped with lenticels helping in gas exchange, and they are also rich in phenolic compounds which confer protection against pest and parasites. The mangroves are adapted to salinity based on any of the three mechanisms: (i) salt exclusion; (ii) salt excretion; and, (iii) salt accumulation. The salt regulation at the cellular level is a remarkable adaptation in maintaining osmobalance between cytoplasm (occupying 20% of cell volume) and cell vacuole (covering 80% of cell volume). Mangroves reproduce mostly sexually by flowers. The flowers produce large numbers of pollen grains (around 5-7 lakhs per flower of Rhizophora), but stigma receptivity lasts for a short period, at which pollination should take place. Pollination is by both self and cross mechanisms. The latter is facilitated by wind, insects and birds and in some instances bats. The fertilized flowers may set fruits. Sprouting of propagules may be of different types: vivipary, cryptovivipary, and normal germination on soil. The viviparity allows seedlings to develop salinity tolerance and efficiency in nutrient storage, while attached with the mother plant. The survival and growth of the propagules from mangroves are strongly influence by physicochemical factors. Much of the ecological service of mangroves lies in protecting the coast from solar UV-B radiation, =green house' effects, and fury of cyclones, floods, sea-level rise, wave action and coastal erosion. The root systems of the plants keep the substrate firm, and thus contribute to a lasting stability of the coast. Mangrove swamps act as traps for the sediments, and recycling of nutrients through microbial decomposition processes. The mangroves provide a source of food, breeding grounds and nurseries for many fishes, shellfishes, and other kinds of wildlife such as reptiles, birds and mammals. They further help in offering protection to other associated flora and fauna of the coastal ecosystems and in contributing to complex food webs and energy transfers in the coastal and marine ecosystems. Mangrove forests are extremely important coastal resources, providing forestry products (firewood, charcoal, timber, honey etc.) and fishery products (fish, prawn, crab, mollusk etc.). The mangroves also contain rich sources of novel chemicals with biological activities and bioprospecting potential for development useful products like drugs. Mangroves may be further developed as sources of highly valued commercial products and fishery resources and also as sites for developing a burgeoning eco-tourism, if the mangroves are sustainably managed. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The São Francisco River Estuary (SFRE, Brazil Northeast) comprises significant mangrove forests, important for human populations, and is included in an Environmental Protected Area of sustainable use which does not have a management plan. This work assessed and mapped anthropogenic activities on the mangroves of this estuary and provided a number of guidelines for a local management plan. Satellite images (SPOT 5 and CBERS 2B) of 2008 were processed and a land use/cover map (study area size: 192.4km2) produced and verified by fieldwork. About 93% (178.8km2) of the study area is occupied by natural cover such as: sandy coastal vegetation (147.3km2, 77%), mangroves (30.1km2, 15.7%) and intertidal flats (1.4km2, 0.7%), while 7% (13.6km2) is occupied by human activities as aquaculture (4.5km2, 2.4%) and agriculture (9km2, 4.7%). These uses are spatially distributed within mangroves, accounting for approximately one quarter (7.8km2) of its area, which may indicate the conversion of these forests. Shrimp farming is the main anthropogenic activity, occupying the highest area and occurring within the tallest Rhizophora mangle forests (tree height >15m). We recommend that a management plan for the SFRE considers: the implementation of sustainable aquaculture practices (e.g. small-scale without deforestation of mangroves, use of native species, effluent treatment, socio-economic equity), strategies for the compliance of the laws regarding shrimp farming license and operation and support the creation of community-based cooperatives for the execution of sustainable aquaculture. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","","Conservation; Deforestation; Effluent Treatment; GIS; Brazil; Sao Francisco Estuary; Aquaculture; Conservation; Deforestation; Effluent treatment; Estuaries; Geographic information systems; Shellfish; Anthropogenic activity; Coastal vegetation; Environmental law; Environmental Protected Area; Human activities; Human population; Management plans; Satellite images; GIS; human activity; image analysis; land cover; land management; mangrove; protected area; shrimp fishery; Environmental protection","","","","","INPE; Society for Conservation GIS; Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (07/56784-9, 2010/20028-9)","This study was undertaken with the financial support of FAPESP (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, Process 07/56784-9 and 2010/20028-9).

Failure to link ecological processes and their societal benefits has favored highly destructive aquaculture and tourism developments that threaten mangroves and result in costly ""externalities."" Specifically, the potentially irreparable damage to fisheries because of mangrove loss has been belittled and is greatly underestimated. Here, we show that, in the Gulf of California, fisheries landings are positively related to the local abundance of mangroves and, in particular, to the productive area in the mangrove-water fringe that is used as nursery and/or feeding grounds by many commercial species. Mangrove-related fish and crab species account for 32% of the small-scale fisheries landings in the region. The annual economic median value of these fisheries is US $37,500 per hectare of mangrove fringe, falling within the higher end of values previously calculated worldwide for all mangrove services together. The ten-year discounted value of one hectare of fringe is >300 times the official cost set by the Mexican government. The destruction of mangroves has a strong economic impact on local fishing communities and on food production in the region. Our valuation of the services provided by mangroves may prove useful in making appropriate decisions for a more efficient and sustainable use of wetlands. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Discounted values; Economic benefits; Ecosystem services; Rhizophora fringe forest; Small-scale fisheries","Angiosperms; Animals; Biomass; Crustacea; Ecosystem; Environment; Fisheries; Fishes; Geography; Mexico; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Trees; Decapoda (Crustacea); Rhizophora; Rhizophoraceae; article; biodiversity; cost; economic aspect; ecosystem; fishing; food industry; government; Gulf stream; mangrove; priority journal; United States","","","","","","","Blaber S.J.M., Mangroves and fishes: Issues of diversity, dependence, and dogma, Bull Mar Sci, 80, pp. 457-472, (2007); Bowman H.H.M., Ecology and physiology of the red mangrove, Proc Am Philos Soc, 56, pp. 589-672, (1917); Mumby P.J., Et al., Mangroves enhance the biomass of coral reef fish communities in the Caribbean, Nature, 427, pp. 533-536, (2004); Dorenbosch M., van Riel M.C., Nagelkerken I., van der Velde G., The relationship of reef fish densities to the proximity of mangrove and seagrass nurseries, Estuar Coast Shelf Sci, 60, pp. 37-48, (2004); Nagelkerken I., Et al., How important are mangroves and seagrass beds for coral-reef fish?

This study aimed to analyse mangrove characteristics, physicochemical parameters, nutrient and primary production derived from mangrove litter and estimate the fish production. The study was conducted at five mangrove sites in North Sumatra and the Aceh Provinces, Indonesia. Two sites represented natural forest at North Sumatra and Aceh (Jaring Halus and Langsa). In comparison, two sites were mangroves converted into oil palm plantations (Pulau Sembilan and Pulau Kampai, North Sumatra). The fifth site was a mangrove forest converted into aquacultural ponds (Percut Sei Tuan, North Sumatra). The study displays the dissemination of mangrove species in five different mangrove sites showing diversity. Avicennia spp found in estuarine near a coastal area, Rhizophora spp spread across the sites, and Sonneratia spp were more likely to occur in the mouth of the upstream river. Litter production at the present study site was dominated by Rhizophora spp., followed by Avicennia spp. This finding was very closely related to the nutrients resulting from litter decomposition in the mangrove ecosystem. The primary production value of 870-1,747 g C m-2 year had a significant role as the beginning of the estuary food chain. Our results show a close association between fish productivity and mangrove management, and conservation status. The highest fish production was found in the well-preserved forests (Jaring Halus and Langsa), followed by the sites converted to palm oil plantations (Pulau Sembilan and Pulau Kampai). At the same time, the least fishing productivity was identified at the fishing ponds (Percut Sei Tuan). The present study provides further evidence of the significant role of mangrove ecosystems for fisheries and calls for effective restoration programs to support local food security along the coast of Indonesia. © 2021 University of Kuwait.

Center, Natl. Marine Fish. Service, Highlands, NJ 07732, 74 Magruder Road, United States","This paper provides the first description of the mangrove cockle. Anadara spp., fisheries throughout their Latin American range along the Pacific coast from Mexico to Peru. Two species, A. tuberculosa and A. grandis, are found over the entire range, while A. similis occurs from El Salvador to Peru. Anadara tuberculosa is by far the most abundant, while A. grandis has declined in abundance during recent decades. Anadara tuberculosa and A. similis occur in level mud sediments in mangrove swamps, comprised mostly of Rhizophora mangle, which line the mainlands and islands of lagoons, whereas A. grandis inhabits intertidal mud flats along the edges of the same mangrove swamps. All harvested cockles are sexually mature. Gametogenesis of the three species occurs year round, and juvenile cockles grow rapidly. Cockle densities at sizes at least 16-42 mm long ranged from 7 to 24/m2 in Mexico. Macrofaunal associates of cockles include crustaceans, gastropods, and finfishes. The mangrove swamps are in nearly pristine condition in every country except Honduras, Ecuador, and Peru, where shrimp farms constructed in the 1980's and 1990's have destroyed some mangrove zones. In addition, Hurricane Mitch destroyed some Honduran mangrove swamps in 1998. About 15,000 fishermen,including men, women, and children, harvest the cockles. Ecuador has the largest tabulated number of fishermen, 5,055, while Peru has the fewest, 75. Colombia has a large number, perhaps exceeding that in Ecuador, but a detailed census of them has never been made. The fishermen are poor and live a meager existence; they do not earn sufficient money to purchase adequate food to allow their full health and growth potential. They travel almost daily from their villages to the harvesting areas in wooden canoes and fiberglass boats at low tide when they can walk into the mangrove swamps to harvest cockles for about 4 h. Harvest rates, which vary among countries owing to differences in cockle abundances, range from about 50 cockles/fisherman/day in El Salvador and Honduras to 500-1,000/fisherman/day in Mexico. The fishermen return to their villages and sell the cockles to dealers, who sell them mainly whole to market outlets within their countries, but there is some exporting to adjacent countries. An important food in most countries, the cockles are eaten in seviche, raw on the half-shell, and cooked with rice. The cockles are under heavy harvesting pressure, except in Mexico, but stocks are not yet being depleted because they are harvested at sizes which have already spawned. Also some spawning stocks lie within dense mangrove stands which the fishermen cannot reach. Consumers fortunately desire the largest cockles, spurning the smallest. Cockles are important to the people, and efforts to reduce the harvests to prevent overfishing would lead to severe economic suffering in the fishing communities. Programs to conserve and improve cockle habitats may be the most judicious actions to take. Preserving the mangrove swamps intact, increasing their sizes where possible, and controlling cockle predators would lead to an increase in cockle abundance and harvests. Fishes that prey on juvenile cockles might be seined along the edges of swamps before the tide rises and they swim into the swamps to feed. Transplanting mangrove seedlings to suitable areas might increase the size of those habitats. The numbers of fishermen may increase in the future, because most adults now have several children. If new fishermen are tempted to harvest small, immature cockles and stocks are not increased, minimum size rules for harvestable cockles could be implemented and enforced to ensure adequate spawning.","","Latin America; Anadara grandis; Anadara similis; Anadara tuberculosa; Bivalvia; Rhizophora mangle; artisanal fishery; ecological impact; fishery management; habitat management; mangrove; reproductive biology; shellfish fishery; shrimp culture","","","","","","","Altamirano M., Bravo M., Elao R., Noboa R., Rosero J., Otorgacion, en custodia, de un area de manglar a un grupo de usuarios en el estero Saca Mano, (1998); Ampie C.L., Cruz R.A., Tamano y madurez sexual de Anadara tuberculosa (Bivalvia:Arcidae) en Costa Rica, Brenesia, 31, pp. 21-24, (1989); Taller sobre politica national de manejo del manglar, PMRC Bull, 39, (1999); Honduras congress declares protected areas of the Pacific, Mesoamericana, (1999); Ardila C.L., Cantera J.R.K., Diagnostico de la pesca artesanal de moluscos en algunas regiones del Pacifico Colombiano, Pacifico Sur.

As a way to demonstrate that the behaviour and trajectory of complex whole systems are not epiphenomenal to the properties of the small parts, a set of conceptual models from more reductionistic to more holistic were enunciated. These models integrate the scientific information published until present for this mangrove ecosystem. The sustainability of different management scenarios (forestry and fishery) was assessed. Since the exploitation of mangrove trees is not allowed according Brazilian laws, the forestry was only included for simulation purposes. The model simulations revealed that sustainability predictions of reductionistic models should not be extrapolated into holistic approaches. Forestry and fishery activities seem to be sustainable only if they are self-damped. The exploitation of the two mangrove species Rhizophora mangle and Avicenia germinans does not appear to be sustainable, thus a rotation harvest is recommended. A similar conclusion holds for the exploitation of invertebrate species. Our results suggest that more studies should be focused on the estimation of maximum sustainable yield based on a multispecies approach. Any reference to holistic sustainability based on reductionistic approaches may distort our understanding of the natural complex ecosystems. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Box 43, South Africa","Members of the rural communities living around the edges of the Kosi Lake system in northern KwaZulu-Natal have been subsistence users of the resources of the lakes, estuary and surrounding swamp forest for many generations. Women and children dig up a variety of crabs in the mangrove ecosystem, and in the late 1980s collected as many as 638 000 crabs a year. The red mangrove crab Neosarmatium meinerti de Man, 1884 (Crustacea: Decapoda: Grapsidae: Sesarminae) constituted the major proportion of these catches, while Scylla serrata and Cardisoma carnifex made up the rest. However, subsistence fishing effort and catches have been reduced steadily, declining from about 5000 outings p.a. and between 2 and 4 × 105 crabs p.a. in the 1980s, to about 1000 outings and 1.3 × 105 crabs in the late 1990s. CPUE has increased from 66 to 145 crabs/person/outing during this period. Crab densities ranged between 0.35/m2 on the high shore and 11.4/m2 on a densely vegetated island, but it was not clear what factors most affected crab density. Densities inside and outside a 'sanctuary area' were not significantly different, although there were significant differences in densities among sites within the 'sanctuary area'. Stock size within the entire mangrove area of Kosi was estimated as 728 514 N. meinerti, but this is almost certainly an underestimate of the total stock size. Sex ratios in the N. meinerti population were not significantly different from 1:1 but above 38 mm carapace width (CW) male crabs considerably outnumbered females. Females matured at 24.9 mm CW and mean sizes of crabs captured by subsistence harvesters were 33.4 mm and 31.3 mm CW for males and females, respectively. Instantaneous natural mortality was estimated at M = 2.27 and fishing mortality F = 0.83. The N. meinerti population in the Kosi mangrove system appears to be sustainably exploited.","Brachyura; Crab density; Crustacea; Sex ratios; Subsistence fishery","Kosi Lakes; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa; Brachyura; Cardisoma; Cardisoma carnifex; Cardisoma carnifex; Crustacea; Decapoda (Crustacea taxon); Decapoda (Crustacea); Gecarcinidae; Gecarcinidae; Grapsidae; Grapsidae; Miletinae; Neosarmatium meinerti; Portunidae; Portunidae; Rhizophora mangle; Scylla; Scylla serrata; Scylla serrata; catch per unit effort; catch statistics; crab fishery; mangrove; subsistence; sustainability","","","","","","","Begg G.W., The Kosi system: Aspects of its biology, management and research, Studies on the Ecology of Maputaland, pp. 358-372, (1980); Breen C.M., Hill B.J., A mass mortality of mangroves in the Kosi Estuary, Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa, 38, 3, pp. 285-303, (1969); Butterworth D.S., Punt A.E., Borchers D.L., Pugh J.G., Hughes G.S., A manual of mathematical techniques for linefish assessment, South African National Scientific Programmes Report, 160, pp. 1-83, (1989); Cooper K.H., A report on mangroves in South Africa, Project Report, Wildlife Society, Natal Field Work Section, 9, pp. 1-9, (1968); Emmerson W.D., Seasonal breeding cycles and sex ratios of eight species of crabs from Mgazana, a mangrove estuary in Transkei, southern Africa, Journal of Crustacean Biology, 14, 3, pp. 568-578, (1994); Emmerson W.D., Mcgwynne L.E., Feeding and assimilation of mangrove leaves by the crab Sesarma meinerti de Man in relation to leaf-litter production in Mgazana, a warm-temperate southern African mangrove swamp, Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 157, pp. 41-53, (1992); Kyle R., Pearson B., Fielding P.J., Robertson W.D., Birnie S.L., Subsistence shellfish harvesting in the Maputaland Marine Reserve in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Rocky shore organisms, Biological Conservation, 82, pp. 183-192, (1997); Kyle R., Robertson W.D., Birnie S.L., Subsistence shellfish harvesting in the Maputaland Marine Reserve in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Sandy shore organisms, Biological Conservation, 82, pp. 173-182, (1997); Macnae W., Mangrove swamps in South Africa, Journal of Ecology, 51, pp. 1-25, (1963); Micheli F., Gherardi F., Vannini M., Feeding and burrowing ecology of two East African mangrove crabs, Marine Biology, 111, pp. 247-254, (1991); Pauly D., On the interrelationship between natural mortality, growth parameters and mean environmental temperature in 175 fish stocks, Journal du Conseil CIEM, 39, 3, pp. 175-192, (1980); Pauly D., Ingles J., Neal R., Application to shrimp stocks of objective methods for the estimation of growth, mortality and recruitment-related parameters from length-frequency data (ELEFAN I and II), Penaeid Shrimps - Their Biology and Management, pp. 220-234, (1984); Ricker W.E., Computation and interpretation of biological statistics of fish populations, Bulletin of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada, 191, pp. 18-382, (1975); Robertson W.D., Kruger A., Ecology, population dynamics and fishery of ghost crabs (Ocypode spp.), Oceanographic Research Institute Report on Research for the Period April 1994 to March 1995, 114, pp. 13-18, (1995); Skov M.W., The influence of methodology, tidal phases, season and animal sex on density estimates of Neosarmatium meinerti (De Man), Conference on Advances in Marine Sciences in Tanzania Zanzibar (Tanzania), (1999); Snedaker S.C., Mangroves: Their value and perpetuation, Natural Resources, 16, pp. 179-188, (1978); Steinke T.D., Rajh A., Holland A.J., The feeding behaviour of the red mangrove crab Sesarma meinerti de Man, 1887 (Crustacea: Decapoda: Grapsidae) and its effect on the degradation of mangrove leaf litter, South African Journal of Marine Science, 13, pp. 151-160, (1993); Ward C.J., Steinke T.D., A note on the distribution and approximate areas of mangroves in South Africa, South African Journal of Botany, 1, pp. 51-53, (1982); Warren J.H., The use of open burrows to estimate abundances of intertidal estuarine crabs, Australian Journal of Ecology, 15, pp. 277-280, (1990)","B.I.

Twelve permanently open stream mouth estuaries on O‘ahu were sampled from September to October 2014. Abiotic factors and fish community data were correlated with percent mangrove cover and the Landscape Development Intensity Index to examine potential relationships among mangroves, humans, and fish communities. The three most abundant species, of 20 species caught, were Kuhlia xenura, Mugil cephalus, and Mulloidichthys flavolineatus. Of these three native species, 99% of the individuals caught were juveniles indicating the overall importance of stream mouth estuaries as juvenile habitat. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis of fish community data showed that K. xenura, M. cephalus, and Lutjanus fulvus were more abundant in shallower sites with lower salinity and higher percent mangrove cover. Stream mouth estuaries with mangroves are important juvenile habitats for the native K. xenura and M. cephalus and the non-native Osteomugil engeli. These species, two of which are important in recreational and subsistence fisheries, will be most likely affected by mangrove removal based on abundance and distribution in mangrove-dominated stream mouth estuaries. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Invasive species; Juvenile abundance; Kuhlia xenura; Landscape development intensity index; Mugil cephalus; Stream mouth estuaries","Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Oahu; United States; Kuhlia xenura; Lutjanus fulvus; Mugil cephalus; Mulloidichthys flavolineatus; Rhizophora mangle; Rhizophoraceae; abiotic factor; abundance; estuarine environment; fish; habitat type; index method; invasive species; mangrove; perciform; population distribution","","","","","Department of Land and Natural Resources; Hawai‘i Pacific University; Hawai'i Pacific University, HPU; Nature Conservancy, TNC","Funding text 1: Funding Research funding and equipment was provided by Hawai‘i Pacific University.; Funding text 2: We would like to thank our field assistants C.

Although mangrove litter is thought to represent an important input of organic matter and nutrients to the coastal aquatic systems, the factors determining the quality and size of this litter flux have not been studied so far. We monitored leaf, stipule, twig, and reproductive litter monthly in monocultures of Rhizophora apiculata mangrove forests of 7, 11, 17 and 24 years old in the Camau province, Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Litter traps were used to measure litter fall production from June 2001 till May 2002. Total litter fall was in the range of 8.86-14.16 t DW ha-1 year-1. Leaves were the main component, and represented 70% of litter fall production in all stands. Total litter fall was lower in the older stands but the amount of reproductive litter was significantly higher in these stands (17 and 24 years). Biomass of leaf litter was highest between the end of the wet season and the beginning of the dry season. Phosphorus and nitrogen levels in leaf litter were significantly higher in younger than in older stands. Overall, our study indicated that young stands produced the highest input of litter and particularly of nitrogen and phosphorus to the surrounding aquatic system. Consequently, these stands contribute significantly to the fisheries. © Springer 2005.","Biomass; Mangrove; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Vietnam","Asia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam; World; Rhizophora apiculata; aquatic ecosystem; leaf litter; mangrove; swamp","","","","","Netherlands Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education, Nuffic","This research was a part of the MHO-8 project for Environmental Management of Coastal Resources in the Mekong Delta, a co-operative project be- tween Wageningen University, The Netherlands and Can Tho University, Vietnam.

Mangrove of the area (7100 Ha) has been gradually decreasing by human pressure especially for fisheries purposes. A barycentric supervised classification and a textural analysis were applied. As an intermediate data, infrared color aerial photographs at 1/30 000 (1981) were interpreted manually. At least two mangrove types of mangrove could be identified from the SPOT image. Dense mangrove was found in petak 7, petak 8, petak 9 and petak 12. In the other petaks, mangrove were less than 20% of their surface.

Mangrove is known to be a natural water quality filter and microbiological buffer of pathogen and prebiotics. However, it is unclear how and to what extent Rhizophora apiculata plantation is of benefits to the gut microbiota and growth over mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) aging. To address these concerns, we explored the bacterial communities in mud crab gut and rearing water at 45, 114, and 132 days after incubation, roughly corresponding to juvenile, pre-adult, and adult stages of mud crab. Results showed that 1-year R. apiculata plantation slightly increased the body weight of mud crab and improved water quality to a certain extent. Both bacterioplankton and gut bacterial communities were highly temporal dynamic, while the two communities were significantly distinct (ANOSIM r = 0.90, P = 0.0001). Relative abundances of dominant taxa in water and gut significantly varied between the plantation and the control conditions over mud crab aging. R. apiculata plantation promoted the stability of gut microbiota, as evidenced by more diverse core species. Furthermore, R. apiculata plantation led to the dominance of Verrucomicrobiae species in water and probiotic Bacteroidetes and Lactobacillales taxa in gut. A structural equation model revealed that water variables directly constrained gut microbiota, which in turn affected the body weight of mud crab (r = 0.52, P < 0.001). In addition, functional pathways facilitating immunity and lipid metabolism significantly increased in mud crab gut under the plantation, while those involved in infectious diseases exhibited the opposing trend. These findings greatly expand our understanding of the R. apiculata plantation effects on water quality, gut microbiota, and growth feature of mud crab. Overall, R. apiculata plantation is beneficial for mud crab growth and health. Key Points: • A short-term R. apiculata plantation could potentially improve water quality. • Bacterioplankton is more sensitive than mud crab gut microbiota in response to R. apiculata plantation. • R. apiculata plantation enhances mud crab resistance against pathogen invasion. • R. apiculata plantation alters mud crab gut microbiota, which in turn promotes their body weight. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Crab growth and health; Gut bacterial community; Rhizophora apiculata plantation; Scylla paramamosain; Structural equation model","Animals; Aquaculture; Bacteria; Brachyura; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Life Cycle Stages; Ponds; Probiotics; Rhizophoraceae; Water Quality; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; Decapoda (Crustacea); Lactobacillales; Rhizophora apiculata; Scylla paramamosain; Verrucomicrobiae; Animals; Anthropometry; Health; Probiotics; Water quality; probiotic agent; Bacterial community; Bacterioplanktons; Infectious disease; Lipid metabolisms; Relative abundance; Scylla paramamosain; Structural equation modeling; Temporal dynamics; aquatic organism; bacterioplankton; crab; crab fishery; growth; microbial community; microbiology; microorganism; plant; relative abundance; water quality; Article; bacterioplankton; bacterium; body weight; controlled study; intestine flora; Lactobacillales; mangrove; microbial community; nonhuman; plantation; Rhizophora apiculata; Scylla paramamosain; Verrucomicrobiae; water quality; animal; aquaculture; Brachyura; classification; growth, development and aging; intestine flora; life cycle stage; metabolism; microbiology; pond; procedures; Rhizophoraceae; Bacteria","","","","","Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Zhejiang Province, (LR19C030001); Ningbo University; Agriculture Research System of China, (CARS-48); China Agricultural Research System, CARS","This work was supported by the China Agriculture Research System (CARS-48), the Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Zhejiang Province (LR19C030001), and the K.C.

Increased predation risk has been attributed to reduced swimming capabilities; however, the role of refuge (structural shelter) use is still poorly understood. We examined the effect of fishing-related stressors on the ability of subadult Great Barracuda Sphyraena barracuda to attain refuge in an experimental wetland in Eleuthera, The Bahamas. Twenty-two Great Barracuda were either treated as controls with minimum stress, chased to exhaustion, or chased to exhaustion and air exposed for 90 s. Reflex action mortality predictors (RAMP) including ability to maintain equilibrium and bursting response were assessed prior to release at a standardized location. The prop roots of red mangrove Rhizophora mangle provided refuge about 5 m from the release point. Great Barracuda were visually monitored for up to 30 min postrelease to quantify behavior (resting, swimming, directional changes) and the time when refuge was reached. The RAMP scores increased with the degree of stressor, and fish in both fishing-related stressor treatments took significantly longer to reach refuge than control fish, while air exposed fish took significantly longer than fish that were only chased. Prior to reaching refuge, fish exposed to fishing-related stressors spent less time swimming, and changed directions more frequently than control fish, indicating that impaired locomotory capabilities and disorientation inhibited refuge use. The inability to find refuge after an acute stressor such as capture and release fisheries may be an important factor contributing to postrelease mortality for relevant species. © American Fisheries Society 2014.","","","","","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","","Arlinghaus R., Cooke S.J., Lyman J., Policansky D., Schwab A., Suski C.D., Sutton S.G., Thorstad E.B., Understanding the complexity of catch-and-release in recreational fishing: an integrative synthesis of global knowledge from historical, ethical, social, and biological perspectives, Reviews in Fisheries Science, 15, pp. 75-167, (2007);

Kawili St., United States","Fish were sampled from tide pools in Hawaii to determine how exotic mangroves Rhizophora mangle and the use of herbicides to chemically eradicate them are impacting tide pool fish assemblages. Ecological parameters were compared among mangrove-invaded, native vegetated, and non-vegetated tide pools before and after mangroves had been chemically eradicated. Native fish densities were higher than exotic fish densities in all treatments, were dominated by flagtails Kuhlia xenura, did not differ among treatments, and 1 yr after herbicidial eradication of mangroves, were greater than or equal to pre-control densities. Exotic fish densities did not differ between mangrove and native vegetated tide pools, were dominated by mollies Poecilia sp., were significantly lower in non-vegetated vs. vegetated pools, and did not differ before and after mangrove eradication. Significantly smaller native flagtails and exotic mollies were present in mangrove tide pools than in all other treatments. Our data suggests that exotic mangroves in Hawaii are not having an adverse effect on native fish assemblages in tide pools, and may actually provide nursery habitat for native and exotic fish. Furthermore, the presence of vegetation and not its origin may be more influential on exotic fish assemblages. Finally, our data suggests that if chemical eradication of mangroves negatively affected tide pool fish assemblages, those effects are short-lived. Future studies should attempt to quantify the ecological value of native versus exotic vegetation in supporting native (or exotic) fish assemblages. © Inter-Research 2013.","Hawaii; Invasive species;

Therefore, this study was carried out to assess the biodiversity of flora and fauna in the Riau Coastline mangrove ecosystem and its impacts on local communities. The transect was performed to identify soil conditions, distribution, and the dominance of flora species, while field observations and interviews with residents were conducted to determine the presence of fauna and discover the ecosystem’s benefit to the local community's economy. Based on the results, Rhizophora mucronata and Rhizophora apiculata has the highest relative dominance (RDC) and important value index in all observed stations. On the other hand, the fish/water biota species has the highest diversity and have economic that mostly serve as a catch for local fishermen. Ecotourism is also encouraged to boost the community's economy and aid ecological learning for sustainability purposes. The mangrove ecosystem's existence remains sustainable because fisheries are the main commodity, however, logging is less desirable as a source of income. © 2021 WITPress.

In this study, we examine food webs in mangrove- and seagrass-dominated habitats of CWBR using stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen. Our objective was to identify the importance of carbon derived from mangroves and seagrasses to secondary production of aquatic consumers in this poorly studied conservation area. Carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of basal sources and aquatic consumers indicated that the species-rich food webs of both habitats are dependent on riparian production sources. The abundant Red mangrove Rhizophora mangle appears to be a primary source of carbon for the mangrove creek food web. Even though dense seagrass beds were ubiquitous, most consumers in the lagoon food web appeared to rely on carbon derived from riparian vegetation (e.g. Phragmites australis). The introduced Amazon sailfin catfish Pterygoplichthys pardalis had isotope signatures overlapping with native species (including high-value fisheries species), suggesting potential competition for resources. Future research should examine the role played by terrestrial insects in linking riparian and aquatic food webs, and impacts of the expanding P. pardalis population on ecosystem function and fisheries in CWBR. Our findings can be used as a baseline to reinforce the conservation and management of this important reserve in the face of diverse external and internal human impacts. © 2010 Sociedade Brasileira de Ictiologia.","Carbon flow; Food chains; Neotropical; Rizophora mangle; Submerged aquatic vegetation; Vallisneria americana","Hexapoda; Liposarcus; Liposarcus pardalis; Oligacanthorhynchus; Phragmites australis; Rhizophora mangle; Rhizophoraceae; Vallisneria americana","","","","","","","Abrantes K., Sheaves M., Food web structure in a near-pristine mangrove area of the Australian Wet Tropics, Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 82, 4, pp. 597-607, (2009); Armbruster J.W., Page L.M., Redescription of Pterygoplichthys punctatus and description of a new species of Pterygoplichthys (Siluriformes: Loricaridae), Neotropical Ichthyology, 4, 4, pp. 401-409, (2006); Arriaga C.L., Vazquez E.D., Gonzalez J.C., Jimenez R.R., Munoz E.L., Aguilar V.S., Regiones Marinas Prioritarias De Mexico, (1998); Bouillon S., Connolly R.M., Lee S.Y., Organic matter exchange and cycling in mangrove ecosystems: Recent insights from stable isotope studies, Journal of Sea Research, 59, pp. 44-58, (2008); Bouillon S., Raman A.V., Dauby P., Dehairs F., Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of subtidal benthic invertebrates in an estuarine mangrove ecosystem (Andhra Pradesh, India), Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 54, 5, pp. 901-913, (2002); Chanton J., Lewis F.G., Examination of coupling between primary and secondary production in a river-dominated estuary: Apalachicola Bay, Florida, U.S.A, Limnology and Oceanography, 47, 3, pp. 683-697, (2002); Garcia A.M., Hoeinghaus D.J., Vieira J.P., Winemiller K.O., Isotopic variation of fishes in freshwater and estuarine zones of a large subtropical coastal lagoon, Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science, 73, 3-4, pp. 399-408, (2007); Heck Jr. K.L., Hays C., Orth R.J., A critical review of the nursery role hypothesis for seagrass meadows, Marine Ecology Progress Series, 253, pp. 123-136, (2003); Hoeinghaus D.J., Agostinho A.A., Gomes L.C., Pelicice F.M., Okada E.K., Latini J.D., Kashiwaqui E.A.L., Winemiller K.O., Effects of river impoundment on ecosystem services of large tropical rivers: Embodied energy and market value of artisanal fisheries, Conservation Biology, 23, pp. 1222-1231, (2009); Hoeinghaus D.J., Davis S.E., Size-based trophic shifts of saltmarsh dwelling blue crabs elucidated by dual stable C and N isotope analyses, Marine Ecology Progress Series, 334, pp. 199-204, (2007); Hoeinghaus D.J., Winemiller K.O., Agostinho A.A., Landscape-scale hydrologic characteristics differentiate patterns of carbon flow in large-river food webs, Ecosystems, 10, pp. 1019-1033, (2007); Hoeinghaus D.J., Winemiller K.O., Agostinho A.A., Hydrogeomorphology and river impoundment affect food-chain length of diverse Neotropical food webs, Oikos, 117, pp. 984-995, (2008); Hogarth P., The biology of mangroves and seagrasses, (2007); Humphreys W.F., Production and respiration in animal populations, Journal of Animal Ecology, 48, pp. 427-453, (1979); Programa De Manejo De La Reserva De La Biosfera Pantanos De Centl, (2000); McCutchan Jr. J.H., Lewis W.M., Kendall C., McGrath C.C., Variation in trophic shift for stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur, Oikos, 102, pp. 378-390, (2003); Melville A.J., Connolly R.M., Spatial analysis of stable isotope data to determine primary sources of nutrition for fish, Oecologia, 136, pp. 499-507, (2003); Mendoza-Carranza M., Martinez-Gutierrez M.L., Segura-Berttolini E.C., Romero-Rodriguez A., Hernandez-Lopez A., Memorias Del Taller Diagnostico De La Pesca En La Reserva De La Biosfera Pantanos De Centla La Perspectiva Social De Pesca En Los Pantanos De Centla.

In addition, they provide typical forest goods such as timber and firewood; harvesting these can cause forest degradation and loss. In Kenya, a large proportion of the rural population cook using firewood on traditional, inefficient three-stone fires. Although harvesting mangrove wood is illegal, the high poverty rate, absence of alternative fuels and lack of law enforcement mean it is likely to remain widespread, with consequent pressure on the forests. The use of three-stone fires has been associated with high levels of indoor air pollution, causing adverse health impacts. The current project aimed to determine a baseline of wood usage and health burden caused by indoor air pollution at a mangrove dependent community in Gazi Bay, southern Kenya. Basic information about fuel usage and perceived health problems related to indoor air pollution was collected using a questionnaire. Wood usage patterns were recorded for 28 days to establish the average daily wood consumption and main species used. Passive diffusion tubes were used to assess CO concentrations over 24 hours. Particulate pollution for the size fraction PM2.5 was measured during cooking using a DustTrak aerosol monitor. Mean daily per capita wood consumption was 1.2 kg although this varied significantly depending on household size, with larger households using less per capita wood. The mangrove Rhizophora mucronata made up 10% of wood used and people spent, on average, 22 hours per month collecting wood. The mean 24-hour CO concentration was 5.9ppm. The average level of PM2.5 during cooking was 10 mg/m3 respectively. Chronic exposure at those levels is expected to cause significant health impacts of the kinds indicated by symptoms reported from the questionnaires. Improved cookstove introduction in Gazi is recommended as feasible as participants showed not only interest in improved cookstoves and awareness of the health implications from indoor air pollution, but also were willing to invest financially in improved cookstoves. © The Author(s) 2018.","Air pollution; Biomass fuel use; Carbon monoxide; Improved cookstoves; Mangroves; Particulate matter","","","","","","British Council Newton Fund, (275670159)","This work was funded by a grant from the British Council Newton Fund (grant no. 275670159).","Badamassi A., Xu D., Leyla B., The impact of residential combustion emissions on health expenditures: Empirical evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa, Atmosphere, 8, 9, (2017); Bailis R., Edwards R., Kitchen Performance Test (KPT) Version 3.0., (2007); Bailis R., Ezzati M., Kammen D., Greenhouse gas implications of household energy technology in Kenya, Environmental Science and Technology, 37, 10, pp. 2051-2059, (2003); Belkin H., Chapter 16-Environmental Human Health Issues Related to Indoor Air Pollution from Domestic Biomass Use in Rural China: A Review.

Propagule transport was simulated using a finitevolume advection-diffusion model to investigate the effect of dispersal vectors (tidal flow, freshwater discharge and wind), trapping agents (retention by vegetation) and seed characteristics (buoyancy) on propagule dispersal patterns. Sensitivity analysis showed that smaller propagules, like the ovalshaped propagules of Avicennia officinalis, dispersed over larger distances and were most sensitive to changing values of retention by mangrove vegetation compared to larger, torpedo-shaped propagules of Rhizophora spp. and C. tagal. Directional propagule dispersal in this semi-enclosed lagoon with a small tidal range was strongly concentrated towards the edges of the lagoon and channels. Short distance dispersal appeared to be the main dispersal strategy for all four studied species, with most of the propagules being retained within the vegetation. Only a small proportion (max. 5 %) of propagules left the lagoon through a channel connecting the lagoon with the open sea. Wind significantly influenced dispersal distance and direction once propagules entered the lagoon or adjacent channels. Implications of these findings for mangrove restoration were tested by simulating partial removal in the model of dikes around abandoned shrimp ponds to restore tidal hydrology and facilitate natural recolonisation by mangroves. The specific location of dike removal, (with respect to the vicinity of mangroves and independently suitable hydrodynamic flows), was found to significantly affect the resultant quantities and species of inflowing propagules and hence the potential effectiveness of natural regeneration. These results demonstrate the value of propagule dispersal modelling in guiding hydrological restoration efforts that aim to facilitate natural mangrove regeneration. © Author(s) 2013.","","Avicennia officinalis; Ceriops tagal; Decapoda (Crustacea); Rhizophora; Rhizophora apiculata; Rhizophora mucronata; Rhizophoraceae; behavioral ecology; facilitation; habitat conservation; habitat restoration; hydrodynamics; mangrove; numerical model; open ocean; propagule; regeneration; sensitivity analysis; shrimp fishery; vegetation structure","","","","","","","Alongi D.M., Mangrove forests: Resilience, protection from tsunamis, and responses to global climate change, Estuar.

The land-use change inhibits mangrove rejuvenation due to the loss of the land’s ecological memory. In Bali, mangrove in Benoa Bay is showing rejuvenation since the fisheries pond conversion in 1908. This study aimed to compare community structures found in natural and ex-fishery areas on Benoa Bay, Bali. The structure and composition of mangrove vegetation were assessed by using the plot method (n=18), followed by the vegetation analysis of trees, saplings and seedlings, and by the canopy closure estimation through hemispherical photography. Vegetation index such as Shannon-Wiener index of diversity, dominance index, and evenness index were used to assess the community status, while the mangrove health assessment used a protocol from the Decree of the Minister of Environment number 201 of 2004 and the mangrove health index (MHI). The results showed that the ex-fisheries area have more species richness than the natural area, but both were dominated by Sonneratia alba trees. The saplings and seedlings categories, were dominated by Bruguiera gymnorrhiza in the natural area, while in the ex-fisheries area they were dominated by Rhizophora apiculata. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index showed a higher value in the ex-fisheries area, while the dominance index and evenness index were fairly similar. In mangrove health assessment, each location was considered in a good condition, based on the canopy closure and tree density and also categorized as in a moderate condition, according to the MHI. © 2023, BIOFLUX SRL.

Vibrio harveyi is considered as the main causative agent of this disease. The natural substance is proposed to kill or inhibit the growth of pathogenic vibrios. In order to know the potency of mangrove Rhizophora mucronata as a bactericide for V. harveyi, research had been conducted at the Research Institute for Coastal Aquaculture (BPPBAP) from February to May 2013. This research consists of several steps, i.e. 1) collection of plant; 2) drying of the plant; 3) making powder of plant; 4) extraction of plant/herb; 5) qualitative bioassay; and 6) quantitative bioassay. The results showed that qualitatively all part of the R. mucronata collected from Bone regency had activity against V. harveyi, but the leaf part of this mangrove collected from Maros regency did not have this activity, and neither the leaf or bark part of this mangrove collected from Pangkep regency. The values of Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) on V. harveyi were ranged between 1-10.000 mg/L depending on which part of the plant and the origin of the mangrove. The root part of the plant had higher activity against V. harveyi than other parts of the plant. Rhizophora mucronata collected from Bone regency had the highest activity against V. harveyi than that collected from Maros and Pangkep regencies.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Bactericides; Fisheries; Brackish water; Causative agents; Coastal aquaculture; Cultured shrimp; Mass mortality; Minimum inhibition concentrations; Research institutes; Vibrio harveyi; Shellfish","","","","","","","Current Conditions of Aquaculture Resources in Supporting Industrialization of Fisheries Dir.

We present an overview of work on Mexican horseshoe crabs, their situation, and perceived threats and opportunities regarding the conservation of the species. Horseshoe crabs occur along the western, northern, and eastern coasts of the Yucatán peninsula, and are genetically distinct from populations in the United States. Spawning aggregations and nests are found continuously throughout the year, commonly in protected lagoons where mangrove (Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa, Avicennia germinans, and Conocarpus erectus) and sea grass (Thalassia testudinum) communities proliferate. Populations are thought to be dwindling since the 1960s and Limulus is listed as in danger of extinction in Mexican legislation since 1994. The most important localities are within protected areas. Direct exploitation is not an important threat, but coastline modification (especially of mangrove areas and coastal lagoons) for housing and tourism is a major concern. Additional potential threats are the oil industry and shrimp fishery in the southern Gulf of Mexico, but their effects on horseshoe crab populations have not been assessed. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

Additionally, sex- and size composition of the commercial catch and catch per unit of effort (CPUE - the number of crabs captured per fisherman per day) were monitored between 1997 and 2003. Average and maximum crab sizes (carapace width, CW) from all three sampling sites combined were 6.1 cm and 8.8 cm in males, respectively, and 5.5 and 7.3 cm in females. Crabs were largest at the site that had been reportedly less exploited in the past. The overall sex ratio was skewed towards males (53-62%). Egg carrying females were only encountered during the rainy season. Mean crab abundance and biomass was 1.7 specimens m -2 and 142 g m-2 fresh mass. Only large males were commercially harvested (98% > 6.5 cm CW). Their biomass was 53 g m -2 and the Caeté estuary yields an annual production of 1200 t of these large specimens. This is approximately the quantity that is currently being harvested. CPUE was similar in 1997 and 1998, then decreased by 15% until 2000 and stabilized for the rest of the study period. Mean capture size (cm CW) ranged between 7.2 ± 0.5 and 7.5 ± 0.2 and was above the size of 50% (and even 100%) male maturity and the legal minimum capture size. There is no evidence that the Caeté crab population is overfished, despite over 30 years of de facto open access exploitation. Apparently, the selectivity of fishermen and consumers for large male crabs as well as the local artisanal capture techniques are key factors in preventing an overfishing of the Caeté crab population until today. Our results suggest that the economic and social sustainability of this fishery will be affected well before the biological one, which should be considered in the recently proposed coastal co-management plan for the region. © EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD 2005.","Artisanal fisheries; Biomass; Brazil; CPUE; Management; Mangrove crab; Sex ratio; Ucides cordatus","Brazil; Caete Estuary; Para [Brazil]; South America; Western Hemisphere; World; Rhizophora mangle; Scylla; Ucides cordatus; fishery management; population structure","","","","","","","Alcantara-Filho P., Contribuição ao estudo da biologia e ecologia do caranguejo-uçá, Ucides cordatus cordatus (Linnaeus, 1763) (Crustacea, Decapoda, Brachyura), no manguezal do Rio Ceará (Brasil), Arq.

It has an extension of about 220 km2 and is subjected to a considerable human impact through intensive harvest of mangrove crabs (Ucides cordatus) and logging of mangroves. In order to integrate available information on biomass, catches, food spectrum and dynamics of the main species populations of the system, a trophic steady state model of 19 compartments was constructed using the ECOPATH II software (Christensen and Pauly, 1992). Ninety-nine percent of total system biomass is made up by mangroves (Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa), which are assumed to cover about 45% of the total area and contribute about 60% to the system's primary production. The remaining biomass (132 g m-2) is distributed between the pelagic and benthic domains in proportions of 10% and 90% respectively. Through litter fall, mangroves inject the main primary food source into the system, which is either consumed directly by herbivores (principally land crabs, Ucides cordatus) or, when already metabolized by bacteria, by detritivors (principally fiddler crabs, Uca spp.). These two groups are prominent in terms of biomass (80 g and 14·5 g m-2), and food intake (1120 g m-2 yr-1 and 1378 g m-2 yr-1 respectively). According to the model estimates, energy flow through the fish and shrimp compartments is of relatively low importance for the energy cycling within the system, a finding which is contrary to the situation in other mangrove estuaries reported in the literature. The dominance of mangrove epibenthos is attributed to the fact that a large part of the system's production remains within the mangrove forest as material export to the estuary is restricted to spring tides, when the forest is completely indundated. This is also the reason for the low abundance of suspension feeders, which are restricted to a small belt along the Caete River and the small creeks which are watered daily. Phytoplankton, temporarily refloating benthic diatoms, neritic zooplankton and small pelagic fish dominate the (low) pelagic biomass. Total system throughput (10 559 g m-2 yr-1) and mean transfer efficiency between trophic levels (9·8%) calculated by the model fit well into the range reported for other tropical coastal ecosystems. The very high gross efficiency of the fishery (catch/net primary production) of 8·6% and its low trophic level (2·1) is explained by a high harvesting rate of mangroves and the fact that the main animal resource in the system are the mangrove crabs (Ucides cordatus), which feed at the first trophic level. The model was balanced asuming a turnover rate for the land crabs of P/B=0·25 (P/B: production per unit of biomass) which is possibly too high. If this value was replaced by a (possibly more realistic) lower value, the model would not balance, suggesting a situation in which more biomass is being harvested than produced, which hints to an overexploitation of this resource. A ranking of the various system components in terms of their contribution to the system function (ascendency sensu Ulanowicz, 1997) revealed that detritus and associated bacteria contribute 34%, mangroves 19%, fiddler crabs 13%, phytoplankton and microphyto-benthos 10%, mangrove crabs 10%, and the remaining 14 groups 14% to the total ascendency. Summary statistics of the model are given and compared with those of other coastal ecosystems.

The objectives of the study were to determine the relationship between mangrove density and suspended sediment transport occurred in the coastal area of Lamreh Estuary. Sampling was conducted on March until May 2014, three substations were established in this site. The 1                             st                              Substation was toward the sea, the 2                             nd                              substation was in the middle land and the 3                             rd                              substation was toward the land. Square transects method used for mangrove sampling and sediment trap used to ensnare sediment. Three species found in this area were Rhizophora apiculata, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, and Avicennia marina. Furthermore, Rhizophora apiculata dominated in this area. The highest density was Bruguiera gymnorhiza with average 11 ind/100m                             2                              and the lowest density was Heritiera littoralis with average 1 ind/100m                             2                              in the 2                             nd                              substation. The highest sediment transport was in 1                             st                              substation and the lowest was in the 3                             rd                              substation. Sediment transport in the 1                             st                              substation for one month was 5.54 to 6.63 g/cm                             2                             /day with mangrove density was 12 ind/100m                             2                              and sediment transport in the 3                             rd                              substation was 4.87 to 5.52g/cm                             2                             /day with mangrove density was 32 ind/100m                             2                             . The correlation between mangrove density and suspended sediment transport in this area was a negative correlation with the correlation between the two coefficients was ranged from -0.999-0.863 till. The Negative correlation was indicated resources would the high density decrease mangrove sediment transport and the opposite.                          © 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Estuaries; Fisheries; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Coastal area; Indonesia; Land transfer; Marine productivity; Negative correlation; Suspended sediments","","","","","Research and Community Service Institutions of Syiah Kuala, (36/UN.11.2/PP/SP3/2018)","Authors would like to thank the Research and Community Service Institutions of Syiah Kuala for financial assistance under ‘Penelitian Dasar Unggulan Perguruan Tinggi Grants’, with contract number: 36/UN.11.2/PP/SP3/2018.","Dharmawan B., Bocher M., Krott M., Ocean & Coastal Management, 130, pp. 250-259, (2016); Marine and Fisheries Agency of Aceh Besar; Triatmodjo B., Engineering Beach, (1999); Petra J.L., Sastrawibawa S., Riyantini I., Jurnal Perikanan Dan Kelautan, 3, pp. 329-337, (2012); Onrizal, Technical Survey and Data Analysis of Mangrove Resources, (2008); Hartoni Agussalim A., Jurnal Penelitian Sains, 10, pp. 204-211, (2007); Noor Y.R., Khazali M., Suryadiputra I.N.N., Introduction of Mangrove in Indonesia, (2006); Adame M.F., Neil D., Wright S.F., Lovelock C.E., Estuaria, Coastal and Shelf Science, 86, pp. 21-30, (2010); Willemsen P.W.J.M., Horstman E.M., Borsje B.W., Friess D.A., Dohmen-Janssen C.M., Geomorphology, 273, pp. 189-201, (2016); Indawan Ahmadi E., Novitawati R.A.D., Jurnal Natur Indonesia, 14, pp. 212-218, (2012); Arief A., Mangrove Forest and Its Benefit, (2003); Murtiono U.G., Tjakrawarsa G., Pahlana U.H., Study of the role of dominant species in the mangrove sediment entrapment dissolved in Segara Chicks Cilacap, Prosiding Seminar Nasional Penelitian Dan Pengembangan Pengelolaan das, (2012); Widjojo J.B., Sunardi, Media Teknik Sipil, pp. 65-123, (2010); Priya K.L., Jegathambal P., James E.J., Regional Studies in Marine Science, 7, pp. 88-99, (2016); Irham M., Fadla Y., Setiawan I., IOP Conf.
