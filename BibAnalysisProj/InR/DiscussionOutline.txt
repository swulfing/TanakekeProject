Our evualation of the number of publications relating to mangroves, fisheries, and biomass or biodiversity the over time shows that this area is growing in importance. As the world's population grows and anthropogenic effects on our environment creates greater challenges for food security worldwide, CONNECT TO ME. Further, reasons for mangrove loss have been shown to be mostly economic (CHODHURY CITATION), therefore IF RESEARCH CAN SHOW THAT MANGROVES HELP, BIRDS TO STONE RATIO. Further, our analysis of trending topics in this field show that human influence on our environment is driving our need for understanding these systems. CITATIONS ABOUT CLIMATE CHAGNE AFFECTING MANGROVES AND FOOD SECURITY. 

A major finding of this bibliometric analysis was the disparity between the sources of this research and where mangrove-dependent fishery research is most relevant. The countries calculated to have the highest amount of their fisheries reliant on mangrove systems are Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Brazil (ERMGASSEN CITATION) NONE OF THESE ENGLISH SPEAKING. SOME STUFF AND CITATIONS ABOUT ACCESS AND IMPLEMENTATION. LOCAL KNOWLEDGE ALSO PLAYING A ROLE

MENTIONAND CONNECT COLLAB NETWORK BTWN US UK AUS, WHICH ARE ALSO THE MOST CITED COUNTRIES

HOWEVER ACCORDING TO FIG 6, BRAZIL, CHINA AND INDONESIA HAVE SEEN AN UPTICK OF THIS RESEARCH. 

FIGURE 4: Number of countries with highest papers is not the countries with the most mangroves. NO PAPERS IN AFRICA.
